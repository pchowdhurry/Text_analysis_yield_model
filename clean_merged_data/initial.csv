birthday of Franz Xaver Gruber, an Austrian primary school teacher and church organist who composed ""Silent Night"" at the beginning of the 19th century.', ""Let us therefore start to think about our New Year's resolutions for 2011."", 'Throughout 2010 representatives from almost every stakeholder group have been calling for a defined end date.', 'Of course, it is one thing to set a goal, but it is far harder to achieve it.', 'This is very welcome; however, work on the implementation of these specifications is lagging behind and should be accelerated.', ""I have to admit that these five New Year's resolutions are quite demanding.""]","['Talking about Christmas reminds us that 2010 is slowly but surely coming to an end.', ""As in every year, the media will soon be producing reviews of the year's events."", 'All of us have contributed to and are familiar with what has been accomplished in 2010.']","[""Good morning ladies and gentlemen, Walking across the Grand Place and around the Bourse you can see busy preparations under way for this year's Christmas market."", 'I have been told that it will be opened tomorrow and exhibitors from all over Europe will be selling their goods.', 'When we look back at what has happened in the field of payments, it is obvious that Europe has invested a great deal of effort and substantial progress has been made.', 'I will therefore refrain from listing our past achievements but concentrate on the things that remain to be done.', 'Of course it is no secret that, despite this general agreement, the details of such a regulation have been widely debated since the summer.', 'To bridge the gap that exists between this strategic vision and the reality, a framework for the processing of card transactions should be developed and the processing infrastructure providers must subsequently develop the rules and standards that are needed in order to establish technical interoperability for card payments.', 'Another important issue is cards standardisation, which is crucial to ensure the interoperability and harmonised use of cards across Europe.', 'In the area of standardisation, there is a clear separation of responsibilities.', 'Second, the Cards Stakeholders Group is responsible for establishing functional, security and procedural requirements.', 'Therefore, we are closely monitoring the work of the three initiatives that have been launched.', 'It is important to emphasise that we have not selected any ""favourite"" out of the three projects, but treat all three equally.', 'However, the market asks for more certainty and it may be that this must ultimately be provided in the form of a regulation.', 'Among these payment instruments, cash on delivery, credit transfers upon receipt of an invoice and the provision of card credentials to merchants play an important role.', 'We have to ensure that Europe does not lose any more ground in e-commerce, compared with the United States and emerging online markets.', 'In my view, European wide implementation of such innovative ideas is very much needed.', 'I firmly believe that for ""online shopping"" the payments industry needs to deliver a solution that permits customers to pay for their purchases in a safe way.', 'The reason for this is that commercial risk tolerance may differ from social risk tolerance.', 'By sending a number of ambitious messages we have ensured that the necessary attention will be paid to this topic.', 'One of these messages was our expectation that the cards industry in Europe will issue ""chip-only"" cards from 2012.', 'But if the industry decides to retain the magnetic stripe on cards for practical reasons, we would ask that any data enabling the processing of magnetic stripe transactions should be removed.', 'The current levels of fraud clearly show that something needs to be done urgently in this respect.', 'In order to achieve this, we need to have more clarity about the security requirements as well as about the actors involved in setting these requirements.', 'Such a forum would monitor market developments.']","['On Christmas Eve 1818 ""Silent Night"" was performed for the first time, in a chapel in Oberndorf, near Salzburg and subsequently made its way throughout Europe and to the rest of the world.', ""For this reason, I had welcomed the European Commission's decision to organise a public hearing on the issue, which took place last Wednesday."", 'However, I am confident that the European Commission will make this possible through a legislative proposal.', 'This would give banks a range of options to choose from as regards the processing of card payments.', 'Third, various market initiatives have developed implementation standards and specifications for the various domains of card payments.', 'However, I personally believe that the European cards market would also benefit from the power of choice.', 'The Eurosystem has been calling for an additional European card scheme for four years.', 'I would strongly urge the appropriate authorities to work on this issue so that the clarity needed at the European level can be provided.', 'An additional European card scheme - which is as safe and efficient as the best performing schemes today - is a necessary element of an integrated and competitive cards market.', 'Europe is still a patchwork of national online markets, and Europeans are prevented from enjoying the benefits of a single digital market.', 'Traditional payment instruments still dominate payments for e-commerce.', 'However, they were not designed to cope with the needs of the online world and often cannot be used for cross-border transactions.', 'In all but a few countries, card transactions based on secure payment protocols and e-payments based on online banking are still in the minority or are only used for domestic transactions.', 'Therefore, there is a clear need for efficient, low cost, secure and readily available online payment solutions throughout Europe - and ideally beyond.', 'The potential for online payment solutions is great enough to offer scope both for secure card payments and for e-payments based on online banking.', 'Both increased security for ""card-not-present"" transactions and the introduction, throughout Europe, of e-payments based on online banking will provide more payment options for users.', 'The risk-based approach applied by individual banks may not be sufficient to achieve the level of security that is required at the aggregate industry level.', 'This should ensure that sensitive account information can no longer be copied.', 'We have recently launched the idea to set up a Forum for Security Issues and have received a positive feedback from banks.', 'In addition it could enable the relevant authorities, including banking supervisors and central banks, to align their expectations on security.', 'The Eurosystem is currently investigating what could be the precise mandate and composition of such a forum.']"
1,"['We expect there will be glitches.', 'However, I want to confirm at the outset that the Federal Reserve is ready for the Year 2000, and every current indication is that the domestic banking system also is, for all practical purposes, ready for a smooth transition.', ""Much of my emerging confidence results from the fact that the Federal Reserve System is fully prepared for the Year 2000; 100 percent of the Federal Reserve's mission-critical systems are ready."", ""Thus, because of the Federal Reserve's readiness, Americans can have confidence that the nation's basic payments infrastructure is sound and ready to process payments as usual before and after the century date change."", 'These good evaluations reflect years of diligent work by thousands of large and small institutions alike to meet rather aggressive deadlines for mission critical systems set by the regulators.', 'As you may know, banks were required to meet certain milestones for identifying, renovating, implementing, and testing their mission critical automated systems to ensure that their customers would receive the quality and timeliness of service they expect after the century date change.', 'The readiness of the Federal Reserve and the extensive preparations in the banking system do not, however, guarantee perfection.', 'At the Federal Reserve, we have extensive contingency plans, many of them already well tested during hurricanes, blizzards, and other events.', 'It is important to emphasize that we believe such contingency planning to be an important element of planning and preparedness for a wide variety of possible events.', 'It does not mean that we think particular problems are likely.', 'In general, we encourage all banking institutions to undertake appropriate contingency planning, so they will be ready just in case there is an unexpected or unusual set of events.', 'For the special circumstances of the century date change, we have developed additional wide-ranging plans to deal with contingencies of all kinds, even though we expect the banking system to operate normally.', 'Let me give you some examples.', 'As lender of last resort, the Federal Reserve always is ready to provide short-term loans to banks and thrifts that experience temporary liquidity needs.', 'For additional liquidity, the Federal Reserve announced a plan to help healthy institutions meet credit demands late this year and in the first quarter of 2000 should they face short-term liquidity problems.', 'Just as the Federal Reserve has planned for even very remote contingencies, individual banks and thrifts also have been required to extend existing contingency plans to address new risks posed by Year 2000 and test these plans.', 'These plans are meant to ensure that customers can be confident they will have access to their funds during the century date rollover period.', 'For example, each institution was required to develop a liquidity plan describing how it would meet demands for cash from its customers and how it would meet the credit needs of its community.', 'There were virtually no errors, and the few problems discovered were remedied quickly.', 'This cannot be taken for granted.', 'Finally, good contingency planning, including manual work-arounds may avoid serious problems.', 'Ultimately, however, systems will have to be fixed or replaced, whether before the century date change or after, and the sooner the process is started, the better.', 'In order to achieve that outcome, however, some countries and institutions should focus on mission critical systems, and all should engage in contingency planning as the key activity now.']","['As the countdown to the Year 2000 continues, and with only five months to go until the new year, it is certainly prudent for us to focus now on the Year 2000 readiness of our nation and, indeed, the entire global community.', 'So I applaud the Research Program in Social and Organizational Learning here at George Washington University for sponsoring this wide-ranging conference.', 'These Year 2000 discussions, and others like them around the nation, will help to create public awareness and understanding, which are very important building blocks in the structure of public confidence.', 'At the Federal Reserve Board and the 12 District Banks, we are using today the automated systems that we will use in the Year 2000.', 'As we are all aware, processing and other failures do occur in complex modern automated systems, often in ways that are rarely visible to the public.', 'Moreover, if isolated glitches do emerge, the Federal Reserve and depository institutions will draw on their contingency plans to get systems operating again as promptly as possible.', 'We do know that the largest, most internationally active firms are making good progress toward preparedness.', 'I also know that awareness among financial regulators is high.', 'These public sector efforts are mirrored by regional meetings held by leading members of the private sector.', 'The large test last month does seem to confirm that Year 2000 readiness has improved in many of the more important financial sectors around the world.', 'First, while the financial sector worldwide is considered to be ahead of most other sectors, it is generally thought that the United States still leads most other countries in the degree of preparedness, although some are as advanced as we are.', 'It is important that emerging and newly industrialized economies making good progress toward preparedness, and there are many, disclose that as clearly as possible.', 'Those ""emerging market economies"" that are not making satisfactory progress should disclose their status and seek assistance as they work to remediate mission-critical systems and engage in contingency planning.', 'Thus, I believe that the Year 2000 in the financial sector of the United States and many other countries is really less of a technical issue now than it was last year at this time.', 'The progress we see in the global financial sector and the evidence from successful cross-border and domestic tests are also positive signs.', 'Thus, with the technical and business elements generally making good progress, the real issue remaining for the United States and other leading countries is that of public awareness, understanding, and ultimately, public confidence.', 'We should all recognize that the Year 2000 event is unique in that we all know that it will occur, but exactly what will occur is uncertain.', 'Many emerging market and newly industrialized countries are making good progress.', 'Similarly, I would expect any international disturbances to be limited in terms of the number of institutions and countries affected.', 'By remaining dedicated for the next five months we can all ensure that the work of the last several years is completed fully, and any remaining risks are minimized.']","['Over the course of several days, this assembly has discussed important issues in many sectors of our economy.', 'I will come back to the confidence issue in a few minutes, but I will commence with a review of progress to date.', 'Nothing this complex can be completely without fault.', 'These tests have gone extremely well.', 'The small handful of institutions that have not yet met the regulatory milestones are, I assure you, receiving the full attention of the regulators.', 'We fix these annoying minor faults every day and go on, and this is what we will do at the time of the century date change.', 'This inventory will be more than enough to meet any conceivable demand for cash.', 'However, in my role as Chairman of the Joint Year 2000 Council, which is an international group of financial regulators representing banking, insurance, and securities regulators, as well as central bankers and payment system overseers, I have information that helps bring some of the issues into clearer focus.', 'The Joint Year 2000 Council has held meetings in all regions of the globe.', 'These regional meetings have been attended by regulators from over 100 countries.', 'Similarly, the United Nations hosted a meeting for Year 2000 Coordinators in June, which was attended by representatives of more than 170 countries.', 'Surveys of international financial regulators, as well as my own conversations with many of them, also have demonstrated that a recognition of the problem increasingly has been translated into concrete plans and actions, many of which have gathered momentum in the last six months.', 'Another positive perspective flows from the large and very successful test of domestic and cross-border payments systems last month.', 'The test included sending and receiving payment instructions, and payment settlements.', 'That cross-border test is one example of a broader development.', 'These systems have generally implemented extensive internal testing and most are testing with participants, as well.', 'Domestically, institutions should continue to make preparations for the rollover period through event management and contingency planning, and in a very few cases by further remediation work.', 'Most importantly, this should include maintaining an active effort to keep customers appropriately informed.', 'Full and fact-based information will certainly help individuals maintain perspective and encourage them to avoid taking needless risks.', 'Without solid perspective about Year 2000 preparations, others may fall victim to Year 2000-related frauds or be asked to buy Year 2000 products and services of questionable value.', 'For example, testing programs and in some cases further remediation efforts still need to be made in some countries, although these activities are obviously quite advanced in our major trading partners and the other major industrialized economies.', 'This need for disclosure includes industrial countries, as well as developing countries.', 'My concern is that ""emerging market countries"" is too broad a group of nations, numbering well over 100.', 'Market participants should look for and make those disclosures part of their decisionmaking.', ""Moreover, the relevant regulators here and around the world know what needs to be done over the next five months, and are communicating with the business leaders managing the world's financial institutions."", 'In this environment, we should listen to the most reasonable and responsible sources.', 'Part of maintaining public confidence is fact-based disclosure to both the public at large and to market counterparties.', 'Disclosure still remains an issue for some, particularly as ""emerging market economies"" seek to distinguish those making good progress from those that need to increase efforts.', 'For some countries, technical challenges may remain, particularly for those that recognized this problem relatively recently.', 'Finally, we know that there are likely to be some glitches, which I would expect to be small and of short duration.', 'I believe that those who have been working on this effort will rise to the challenge.']","['At the Federal Reserve, we are closely involved with preparations for the century date change in the financial sector here and around the world.', 'In fact, we have been testing these systems for more than a year with banks and thrifts that are linked to us around the country for payments and related functions.', ""This is significant because the Federal Reserve Banks operate the hub of the nation's payments system, providing depository institutions with essential services in cash, checks, and electronic payments."", ""Another fact that gives me confidence in the domestic financial sector's preparations for the century date change is that almost all of the nation's banks, thrift institutions, and credit unions are ready for Year 2000."", 'No one can say that there will be no problems in the banking system when the century date rolls over.', 'One recent example of our contingency planning is the establishment of special liquidity arrangements for borrowing by depository institutions.', 'This borrowing arrangement, by its very existence, even if it is not widely used, should provide assurance to the public and banks that the lender of last resort will be there to provide liquidity should banks need it during the rollover to 2000.', 'To be prepared in case our fellow citizens choose to have a little extra cash on hand for the century rollover--it will be a long holiday weekend for many, after all-- the Federal Reserve is building an inventory of currency in our vaults.', 'Given the high expectation that all normal payments methods will work, we do not expect that there will be any unusual demand for cash, but if there is, we will be ready to meet it.', 'For some institutions, getting extra cash from the Federal Reserve or borrowing in the financial markets or from the Federal Reserve may be part of their plans.', 'Turning now to the international arena, I am encouraged at the progress being made this year by most foreign financial regulators and the largest financial institutions to meet the Year 2000 challenge, but I am somewhat less certain of the international preparations than I am of our domestic readiness.', 'Let me emphasize that I am somewhat less certain, not fearful.', 'Given the wide variety of institutions and systems around the world, and obvious difficulties in systematically collecting definitive and current information regarding Year 2000 readiness, no one can know for certain all of the international outcomes of the century date change.', 'The preparation of our domestic payments links is bolstered by the fact that foreign financial services firms are generally believed to be among the best prepared in their respective countries.', 'They are forced to do so in order to remain viable in their home markets and globally.', 'In this test using a simulated Year 2000 environment, more than 500 financial market participants from 19 countries were able to complete transactions in 34 national and international payment systems.', ""We are getting increasingly positive information regarding the preparedness of core financial systems overseas, importantly including payment and settlement systems, that could, if not prepared, trigger difficulties in the world's financial operations."", 'We should not let these recent successes lead to complacency, either domestically or internationally.', 'Because of the important role of public confidence in sustaining financial stability during an event such as the Year 2000 rollover, in which there are inevitable uncertainties, persistent and effective public communication is essential.', 'On the other hand, incomplete information or misunderstanding may cause some to take risks such as shifting deposits from banks, or withdrawing large sums of cash, or even making unreasoned decisions about other assets they hold.', 'Similarly, there is still work to be done internationally.', 'Second, all countries should hold themselves to the highest standard of self-disclosure, so that financial markets can make fully informed decisions.', 'Similarly, financial market participants need to seek full information on international preparedness, and make reasonable, calm, and considered--not hasty--trade-offs between risk and reward.', 'In particular, financial institution preparedness can be hampered by a lack of preparedness in critical infrastructure--telecommunications, power, and water.', 'I would, however, note that many of the countries that may be the farthest behind are also those that are least dependent upon technology.', 'Similarly, many of these countries have the fewest links to the international financial markets, and their performance during the century date change is least likely to have a significant cross-border impact.']"

first step.', 'This essay reports the outcomes of our literature review and sectoral analysis that undertake this task .', 'Good work and productivity seem, on the whole, to be positively correlated.', 'A positive correlation was found in four of the five dimensions of good work for which evidence exists in existing literature.', 'Evidence for a fifth is mixed; some research found positive correlations, others not.', 'With this sectoral analysis of the 17 sub-indictors across the seven dimensions, seven showed higher productivity with the better the quality of work.', 'The correlation is stronger for bad work and poor productivity.', 'This should be a major concern and potential point for intervention.', 'This suggests interventions that focus on different dimensions of good work may deliver more substantial productivity gains than others.', ""In some cases the existence of 'decent work' rather than 'excellent work' seems to the optimal point for generating productivity gains."", 'Below we explain our process and findings in more detail.', 'Pay and benefits Health, safety and psychosocial wellbeing Job design and nature of work Voice and representation Work-life balance Terms of employment Social support and cohesion balance; and voice and representation.', 'Each dimension has sub-indicators.', 'Productivity is an economic measure of the efficiency with which inputs into production are converted into outputs of goods and services.', 'Although researchers use a variety of measures and indicators for productivity, there is at least an official measure.', 'However, productivity can be hard to capture in some sectors.', 'The most obvious are health care and the public sector generally, where quantifying output can be difficult.', 'Using the key terms within the good work dimensions and the official and other measures of productivity, the first task of our investigation was a .', 'Examining the five areas that are researched in the extant literature, there are grounds for optimism.', 'For the four of the five dimensions of good work for which evidence exists - pay and benefits; health, safety and psychosocial wellbeing; job design and the nature of work; and work-life balance - a positive impact on productivity is found.', 'A small number of studies have used multidimensional indexes of job quality to examine its relationship with productivity and any causality.', 'These analyses find that productivity appears to positively impact job quality, although the impact of job quality on productivity is mixed and is dependent on the type of sector.', 'It needs to be said, however, that few studies have tried to establish a causal link, despite emerging opinion that there might be a virtuous circle, with a mutually beneficial, even reinforcing, relationship between good work and productivity.', 'Following our literature review, we undertook a sectoral analysis to produce new insights into job quality and productivity.', 'It enables the first examination of the relationship between good work and productivity using all seven dimensions.', 'It is based on every worker within a given sector having the same level of productivity but retaining their individual good work responses .', 'In terms of the relationship between productivity and good work, the descriptive statistics calculate output per person hour for sub-indictors across the seven dimensions.', 'The sub-indicators and dimensions are set out in Table 2.', 'Table 2 summarises the nature of the relationship between labour productivity and each of the sub-dimensions of good work cross-sector.', 'The poorest good work category had the lowest productivity in 11 of the 17 sub-indicators.', 'However, in the 14 cases where it was possible to move from the poorest quality work up to the second poorest, 13 were associated with an increase in productivity.', 'The combination of a positive relationship between good work and productivity and, more particularly, the inverse-U shape relationship, implies that there is good reason for future policy and practice to focus on the poorest quality work end of the spectrum.', 'Using the new database, we also sought to explain productivity using the two control variables - employment and capital stock - and the seven dimensions of good work Only the effects of the good work variables Five of the seven dimensions have a positive relationship with productivity.', 'Work-life balance is positive but not statistically significant.', 'The same outcomes are found for job design and social support, and there is 14% higher productivity for the best voice and representation than in the poorest.', 'Of the sub-indicators, we highlight just a few examples.', 'In addition, both voice and representation are separately positively related to productivity.', 'The negative value for terms of employment is caused by the considerably greater productivity performance amongst those who think they might lose their job in the next 12 months compared with those who do not think so.', 'This finding is interesting and needs to be explored further because it is also the case that job insecurity is considered to be detrimental for wellbeing.', 'Although the short-run effect of job insecurity might be to produce higher work effort and thereby, higher productivity, the long-term effects may be negative.', 'However, one of the sub-dimensions further illustrates the need to be careful in the interpretation of the finding, as the response of ""never"" to the statement ""After I leave work I keep worrying about job problems"" is significantly negatively related to productivity, while the response of ""occasionally"", which seems an acceptable job characteristic, is associated with the highest productivity outcome and significantly higher than the ""never"" outcome.', 'Terms of employment Pay and benefits Health, safety and psychosocial wellbeing Job design and nature of work Social support and cohesion Voice and representation Work-life balance We also disaggregated the analysis by nine the same as in Table 3, with the exception of the addition of variables that attempt to identify within-sector effects on productivity over and above the all-sector effects shown in the final row of Table 4.', 'As the within-sector effects of good work account for some of the explanation of productivity, it produces a difference in the all-sector results between Tables 3 and 4.', 'The results suggest that there are some important differences between sectors in the effects of good work on productivity.', 'Where values are insignificant, only the possible direction of the impact on productivity is shown.', 'The primary sector and the health sector stand out in this regard, although we have already noted the problem of defining productivity in the public sector.', 'On the other hand, the knowledgeintensive sector suggests considerable support for the link between good work and productivity, with the exception of health, safety and psychosocial wellbeing.', 'These initial findings are positive and encouraging.', 'They suggest that good work can be encouraged as a route to improved productivity.', 'Poorer quality work strongly correlates with poor productivity.', 'Action from government to encourage businesses to introduce changes across some of the seven dimensions that most strongly correlate to productivity could be valuable.', 'We have said that there are gaps in the evidence base on good work and productivity.', 'The review of extant literature confirmed that there are inconsistencies in how both job quality and productivity are measured, and some measures are simply proxies.', ""Although employment has been trending towards record highs, workers' productivity has been flat-lining for the last decade, as have real wages."", 'Moreover, those workers that already have lower wages and lower levels of education, skills and employment opportunities are likely to face the most pressure from automation.', 'So what are the prospects for enhancing both productivity and are the trade-offs and the win-wins?', 'Employment rates, the total number of people in employment and the total number of hours worked are at an all-time high .', ""People's relationship with their boss ."", ""They may only impact some, sometimes small, segments of the population, but stated goal is 'good jobs and greater earning power for all '."", 'Although the aggregate economic effects of industrial revolutions in the past have been positive, the impact on individual people, firms, towns and sectors has often been negative .', 'The people that are likely to be most affected are those that are already disadvantaged.', 'Employment in occupations with the lowest qualifications is likely to grow 10 percentage points less to 2030 than those with the highest.', 'Occupations with currently high unemployment rates, and low vacancy rates, are likely to face the least employment growth to 2030 .', ""Finally, places like Bristol and London - with currently higher pay - will probably see continued robust jobs growth, while In other words, many of today's disparities are likely to be exacerbated by the fourth industrial revolution."", 'McKinsey Global Institute estimates that by adopting automation and artificial annual productivity growth by 1-2%

winner-take-all companies.', 'It is a well-established fact that companies with happier and more engaged workers also perform better .', 'Better managers invest in supporting, training and coaching their staff .', 'Workers whose skills better match their job requirements are more productive and motivated .', 'In such a positive workplace, technology is most likely to augment, not substitute, by overtaking routine, mundane and simple tasks while leaving more creative, complex, social and emotional work to humans.', 'The best answer I can offer is that our prevailing narratives about the economy perpetuate too simplistic a mental model; one that I, too, instinctively revert to.', 'The model has remained dominant for good reasons and it is often enormously powerful in explaining observed phenomena.', 'But it lacks the nuance and grit that is now required to shift the needle on productivity and good work.', ""And too many policymakers fail to recognise that businesses are made up of people, not 'homines economici', or utility maximising robots with an infinite capability to make rational decisions."", 'But it is this messy reality that we must understand and embrace if we want to make progress.', 'From trade-offs to increasing returns.', 'From linear and additive to exponential and multiplicative.', 'From equilibria to complex adaptive systems.', ""The good news is that we do know 'what works' for changing mindsets ."", 'Digitalisation has dominated discussions about the economy in recent years.', 'Depending on your point of view, digitalisation may be seen as a panacea for slow growth; a minor change that will have little impact compared to previous technologies; a threat to jobs; or a phenomenon that offers opportunities to transform work.', 'This essay reviews the arguments concerning the impact of digital technologies on both productivity and jobs, from the lens of both consumers and workers.', 'The economic debate, however, takes a much broader definition and includes anything that enables, generates, stores or processes data.', 'Therefore, digitalisation is seen as encompassing broadband and high-speed internet and mobile internet technologies; big data and machine-learning techniques to analyse these data; cloud services that store and process data; new ways of doing things that include the and augmented reality technologies; tools that enhance production such as enterprise resource planning, customer relationship management, and supply chain management; and new ways of communicating such as social media.', 'Those who emphasise the transformative nature of these technologies are keen to distinguish them from the earlier wave of ICTs, which included communications and computer hardware and software.', 'The present digital revolution affects all sectors of the economy, from those that have seen many productivity-enhancing changes, such as manufacturing, to those less subject to technological transformations in the past, such as adult social care.', 'Given the broad nature of this definition, it is surprising that, to date, there is not strong evidence that these technologies have delivered discernible additions to productivity growth.', 'It is now well known that there has been a pronounced productivity slowdown that is widespread across developed economies and also that the slowdown started in the mid-2000s before the financial crisis.', 'A section of the literature considers these trends to be unbelievable given the size and scope of digital technologies.', 'Research carried out by academics, statistical offices and international organisations, such as the to put some numbers on these possible sources of biases.', 'The conclusions point to the importance of quality change and intangible investments as areas where official data may be missing some crucial activity, but cannot explain the productivity slowdown.', 'But neither are activities such as cleaning and child care, which are likely to swamp any new activities arising from digital technologies.', 'The incorrect measurement of real output is not unimportant, but the more we delve into this the less convinced we are that it explains the productivity downturn.', 'A more optimistic argument is that the productivity gains are not yet visible due to adjustment costs, but are just around the corner.', 'This relies on the idea that benefitting from digital technologies requires reorganisation of production and retraining of workers, often involving firms spending large amounts on intangible investments.', 'Once this transition period is worked through, we should witness increased productivity growth.', 'A related argument is that although there are frontier firms who have gone through a digital transformation, there is also a long tail of laggard firms who either lack the knowledge, leadership, workforce skills or finance to adopt the new technologies.', ""A more pessimistic scenario is based on the observation that digital technologies have concentrated production in the hands of a few 'superstar' firms, often internet-based giants whose monopoly power deters entry of new firms."", 'Productivity change in the volume of output of goods and services may have slowed, but connected consumers are, nevertheless, much better off in many ways than they were before the advent of digitalisation.', 'Although there is obviously something in this argument, we are some way from consensus on how to measure consumer welfare.', 'The earlier wave of technologies appeared to be skill-biased, raising the employment and wage shares of the highly skilled relative to those with low or medium skills.', 'The literature developed from a concentration on employment and returns of individuals with different characteristics to focusing on the tasks they carry out in the workplace.', 'Digital technologies are widely seen as reinforcing these previous trends, but their broader applications threaten not just those with low or medium skills but all workers.', 'The extreme position is that in a relatively short space of time almost all jobs will disappear, although more measured responses point to many areas of work that will still need human versatility and ability to innovate.', 'It is tasks, not necessarily jobs, that disappear and many tasks that are automated are mundane and repetitive.', 'These arguments suggest that digitalisation can lead to a transformation of work, rather than a replacement of workers.', 'It is still too early to say if the digital revolution will ultimately lead to significantly less jobs or to better jobs.', 'There will undoubtedly be some job losses, as there have been for all technological changes, but implementing the new technologies to gain the most benefit from them will probably also lead to new tasks and more jobs.', 'There are likely to be high personal costs for those individuals caught up in this transition, and past experience suggests dealing with this is very difficult.', ""In summary, digitalisation has the potential to enhance people's wellbeing through consuming higher quality goods and services, more rewarding work and more enjoyable use of leisure time."", 'Nevertheless, there are also likely downsides, with some individuals losing jobs and a potential concentration of resources in the hands of a small minority, leading to greater inequality.', ""Any consideration of how we can support more 'good work' and higher productivity must therefore take account of the uneven impacts of digitalisation and develop policy responses to support those most at risk by the pace of change."", 'He was talking about the economy as a whole - the more productive the utilisation of labour and capital, the more prosperous an economy - but the same principle is also largely true of firms.', 'Putting to one side rent-seeking, profits can only be grown by the more effective use of people or investment.', 'A firm not improving its productivity is a firm that is, at best, stagnating.', 'Furthermore, as this essay collection demonstrates, this conceptualisation of good work has a positive relationship with productivity.', ""Yet, this is where the quandary emerges because if productivity is 'everything' to firms and good work can clearly help organisational leaders raise it, then we should probably expect to see many more examples of good work being used to boost productivity in the contemporary British economy than we do."", 'This is important because any steps policymakers take to encourage higher productivity through good work must clearly take account of how organisational leaders take day-to-day decisions about work.', 'To complement the data-led findings of other contributions to this collection, this essay attempts to provide fresh insights into the lived experience of the modern workplace.', 'Our conclusions are qualitative, but we hope the granularity provided can add a richness to the ongoing debates about good work, technology and productivity.', 'Despite this, we found both organisations thought about productivity in similar ways and attempted to raise it largely by measuring points of delivery efficiency within the organisation.', ""When we asked the owner of the restaurant directly, 'what does it mean to have a productive day at work here, and how is it communicated to staff?' he explains that 'it is all about speed of service' and 'units through the door'."", 'Even when pressed directly about whether this measurement can capture notions of quality - for example, whether the food is tasty or hot enough - he defaulted to the notion that speed of service can also capture this aspect of productivity.', 'However, it also reflects an operational ethos that elides productivity with efficiency, with measurement entirely focused on the latter.', 'For example, are used to evaluate the quality of care delivered by Clinical Commissioning Groups for patients who have undergone hip replacement surgery.', ""At both our site visits and our employers' workshop, we found the deployment of new technology to be central to how leaders seek to boost productivity; yet, this does not typically appear to be driven by a desire to improve work quality, or at least that is a second order consideration."", 'Across all our research, conversations about how technology is transforming management practices, such as performance management or shift scheduling, were much more common than those about automation substituting human work.', 'Perhaps the largest technology project we observed was the deployment of self-service kiosks at the fast-food restaurant.', 'This has reduced the number of staff working on tills but the overall headcount has stayed the same, with more people now working in the kitchen.', 'At the hospital a handful of robots have been deployed in the cancer ward.', 'However, in contrast to some discussions we had elsewhere in the hospital, their deployment has been driven by patient outcomes rather than efficiency.', 'Clearly, the more efficient utilisation of labour in this way would, by definition, have significant productivity-boosting potential, but ensuring it is rolled out in a way consistent with good work will be a significant policy challenge.', 'In the fast-food restaurant, new technology was primarily introduced to improve efficiency and generate higher consumer demand.', 'Indeed, the most common complaint about technology was that it would occasionally malfunction, which would then make their jobs much harder.', 'Clearly, technology introduces new dependencies into the business, but most were keen to stress how, relatively speaking, it was beneficial.', ""One worker shared her experience of working so quickly during a night shift that she 'felt like a robot'."", ""One method we saw used by managers to motivate workers at the restaurant might best be described as the 'gamification' of work - competitions, with prizes available, for producing good performance."", 'The robots used in cancer surgery provided a good example of where technology is having more positive effects on health care professionals.', ""Robots are seen as a technology that could enable people to 'work much longer from an early age'; for instance by reducing risk of back injury because surgeons 'could be operating on someone while sitting in another room'."", 'We also saw an example of how, when workers have autonomy over the technology they are operating, it can lead to unexpected but productive outcomes.', 'In the hospital, iPads were initially introduced for physicians to update notes with, but it transpired that they were actually more useful for taking photos and examining the progression of injuries.', 'It is clear here that when autonomy interacts with technology, it can generate greater productivity.', 'Not only this, it could allow workers to feel in control, which encourages greater acceptance of innovation.', 'Workers we spoke with at the restaurant valued flexibility over autonomy, pointing to the freedom to choose how to fit their work patterns around their home life as one of the key benefits of working there.', 'Central to the impact of technology on workers is whether it interrupts their core or periphery work; that is, whether it impacts on the elements they identify with and care most about, or on those that they feel do not contribute to their success or happiness.', 'If it is the latter, then workers tend to be largely happy with implementation and do not require in-depth consultation.', 'If it is the former, however, disruption is felt much more profoundly.', 'In the restaurant, many of the tasks did not intrinsically pertain to the core category, and instead workers cited progression and flexibility as their key drivers, and hence were more accepting of technological changes.', 'A common theme across our enquiry was that both managers and workers are broadly optimistic about new technologies but desire a more worker-centred approach to adoption.', 'Many employers we spoke to as part of our enquiry highlighted the importance of job design in ensuring that technology changes will promote both productivity and good work.', 'They could see the benefits on a personal level, recognising that it could highlight how they could improve their performance and the subsequent potential for promotion.', 'We found similar insights at the hospital, where workplace shortages have seen health professionals other than physicians step up to take on more clinical responsibilities.', 'Across both sites we found support for the argument that technology tends to change tasks, rather than whole occupations.', 'Yet if firms can approach technology roll-out in this manner, our findings suggest it can have a key role to play in the future of both good work and higher productivity.', 'The former stems from a fascination with the notion of a fast-moving, but often invisible business model that is driven purely by technology.', 'The business model on which gig work thrives seems to offer the best of both worlds, with the ability to tightly schedule and activate workers to meet potential for maximising productivity and flexibility.', 'Although estimates of the number of gig workers vary, the often-heard claim is that there are almost as many gig workers in Great Britain as there are .', 'No matter the size, the atypical corner of the economy is complex and multi-faceted and it is rightly demanding an urgent review of whether and how it can be considered good work.', 'The government has issued a response with a focus on securing hours of work and notification of cancelled hours.', 'Wellbeing - physical and mental - is increasingly part of the debate about how we live and work.', 'But when it comes to gig work, out of sight could easily mean out of mind, eclipsing the importance of protecting health and wellbeing.', ""A report from Gallup found that 'compared with traditional workers, independent gig workers enjoy much higher levels of flexibility, creativity, autonomy and even feedback'."", 'Gig work is at the front line of an ongoing transformation of the social contract.', 'The point here is not just about legal entitlement; it is also about shifting the culture of uncertainty and rebalancing the give and take of the workplace relationship.', 'There is the need for a new, realistic narrative on what good working relations can look like - a model that drives productivity but also worker engagement and wellbeing in the absence of regular, personal interaction.', ""These 'wicked' problems span low relative productivity and innovation; low pay, unequal pay and in-work poverty; underemployment and skills under-utilisation; work intensification; income inequality and limited social mobility ."", 'Addressing the potential benefits of fair work for productivity involves focusing on the need for supportive management practices that harness the productive potential of labour.', 'The first is that fair work is necessary to deliver inclusive growth.', 'These are, of course, linked because participation without sharing in benefits makes growth unjust, while benefitting without participating in economic life represents a welfare approach rather than an approach to growth .', 'Implicit in discussions of inclusion is a growth effect that is hoped to arise from more people engaging in economic activity and from the positive wider economic benefits thereof.', 'However, what is missing is what comes between participating in economic life and sharing in its rewards - that is, the process of creating value.', 'The workplace is, therefore, the crucial domain in bridging inclusion and growth.', 'Governments and society miss out on tax revenues, and on returns from education and skills investment.', ""Employers' decisions shape the kind of work that is available."", 'Employers who support fair opportunity to enter, develop and progress in work can benefit from better reputation, recruitment and retention, and from having a more diverse workforce with a richness of talent and ideas.', 'By providing fulfilling work that underpins self-belief and self-worth, employers can support improved task participation, and where work is designed to harness skills and talents, this helps unleash creativity and innovation.', 'Ensuring respect at work and ensuring dignified treatment enhances health, safety and wellbeing, with positive implications for productivity.', 'These activities entail practice, policy and research challenges, but also highlight the opportunities and potential of fair work to address real issues relating to labour supply, economic uncertainty, automation, demographic change and environmental sustainability.', 'Improving and enhancing what happens in work and workplaces is, or should be, a key focus of public policy.', 'All five dimensions of fair work support enhanced value creation and are inextricably linked to wellbeing.', 'Capturing impact is complex, but measuring progress remains important to delivering on this ambition.', 'Crucial to the progress of fair work is embedding it in the architecture of government and in the narratives of employers, workers, unions and citizens.', 'Productivity matters because it is the main determinant of living standards and so it affects us all.', ""Higher productivity makes employers more competitive, provides the foundation for wage increases and increases the government's tax revenues."", 'Everyone stands to benefit.', 'This short essay demonstrates how this dire warning has played out in Wales where both productivity and pay are relatively low.', 'The negative consequences of low productivity are recognised by the economic strategy, , for example, it is mentioned 19 times.', 'The picture gets no better when patterns are examined within Wales.', 'This is both reflected in, and reinforced by, relatively low pay in Wales.', 'Rather than falling, this share has been rising.', 'The proportion of employees paid less than the Real Living Wage was 2 percentage points lower in 2012 had the second joint highest proportion of jobs that paid below the Real Living Wage and was one of only two areas that saw the proportion of such jobs increase in prevalence .', 'This patterning of results corresponds to the patterning of productivity performance with, for example, Gwynedd and Anglesey having relatively low productivity alongside a higher prevalence of low pay, and Cardiff and Neath Port Talbot having relatively high productivity but a lower prevalence of low pay.', ""The primary aim of this recommendation is to reduce in-work poverty, which is higher in Wales than elsewhere, but also to protect good employers from unfair competition by unscrupulous employers keen to 'race to the bottom'."", 'It is also designed to shock

relevant - but is there any reason that it should be more successful now than in the past?', 'Today the dynamics of the workplace have changed, there are less antagonistic industrial relations, a

not here.', 'A tightening labour market - with the 16-64 age employment rate rising - is likely to have played a key role, by strengthening the bargaining power of workers in this period.', 'The introduction and development of the National Minimum Wage probably also played a part, directing an increasing share of the income pie to workers.', 'It is worth noting that the share of overall labour compensation distributed as pay, relative to the share accounted by employer National Insurance Contributions and the share taken up by employer pension contributions, has declined over time - in particular, in the period between 1990 and 2008, accounting for one-third of the 24 percentage point decoupling of median pay from productivity.', 'The difference observed in mean and median pay trends accounts for 95% of the overall 24-percentage point wedge recorded between 1980 and 2018.', 'But this is not a story of ever-widening wage inequality.', 'It is the collapse of productivity growth rather than any breakdown in the relationship between wages and productivity that explains the pay squeeze of the last decade.', 'The terms of trade drag associated with the divergence of producer and consumer deflators has certainly played a key role in holding back real-terms wage growth since the financial crisis, but the impact is slight relative to the role played by the slowdown in productivity growth itself.', 'There is no guarantee that a faster-growing economy would result in the same balance between labour and capital and between wages and non-wage compensation for example.', 'In part that means reversing the business investment picture, with recent weakness explaining around two-fifths of the overall under-performance of productivity growth in the postcrisis decade.', 'However, the need to improve the way in which firms adopt innovative technologies and working practices is probably more structural in nature.', ""On that front, it's important that any focus on boosting productivity recognises the extent to which the world of work is changing."", 'The robots have not arrived to take our jobs yet - indeed, our economy could do with a few more of them - but new technologies will alter the way we work over the coming years.', ""That won't happen by accident, but it has the potential to bring significant reward."", 'Adapted from an essay published by

works split shifts to manage childcare with her partner and regularly falls asleep on the bus on the way home to her outer London borough.', 'The proportion of working families that are in poverty has risen over the last 20 years - an unacceptable situation, and a trend that now sees the majority of people of working age experiencing poverty coming from a working household.', 'Seventy per cent of children pulled into poverty come from households where at least one adult works.', ""It's not right that so many working families are locked in poverty."", 'Although there are employees in poverty in all sectors, these households are concentrated in the large low-wage sectors.', 'How these sectors of the so-called everyday economy behave - their business models, sustainability and productivity levels - really matters for the millions of workers on low pay and in poverty.', 'They are large employment sectors with a high incidence of low pay.', 'Around a third of workers in poverty work in these two sectors alone .', 'Social care and the facilities management sector also face similar challenges.', 'Despite the introduction and rising value of the minimum wage, low-income families have seen slower growth in earnings than the average family for much of the last 20 years .', ""At least some of this has happened because people can't find jobs that provide them with as many hours of work as they would like."", 'What if that money was invested more wisely in developing new skills or retraining for a digital working environment; or if we made skills recognition much more portable between employers ?', 'It is also well documented that many low-paid employees remain stuck on low pay and flatter structures in many firms make pay progression challenging .', 'For many employees, lack of genuine flexibility in better paid roles just makes juggling caring and work too difficult; a problem that particularly affects the large number of low-paid mothers in the workforce .', 'There are of course, many great employers in the traditionally low-wage sectors, such as the employers who pay the higher voluntary Living Wage or sign up ; who invest heavily in training and manage their businesses well to give good notice on shifts and hours; or who are developing better progression routes for part-time employees.', 'Low-wage sectors are a concern not just for poverty but also for our economy.', 'But raising productivity in low-wage sectors and in low-productivity firms is not guaranteed to drive up pay in these sectors and firms.', 'Recent research on pay setting shows that firms are more concerned by sector norms; attracting and retaining labour and the National Living Wage rather than linking pay to driving or responding to productivity gains .', 'The discussion on improving productivity and job quality sometimes feels disconnected from the real lives of people on low incomes.', 'Being treated well at work, paid a Real Living Wage, given opportunities to progress and to work the right number of hours should be fundamental aspects of decency at work and should not be seen as a special prize for delivering productivity gains.', 'However, even if our primary focus is raising productivity then we still need to focus on raising job quality.', 'We need to make sure that interventions we design to push up productivity will help create an economy that works for everyone, including low-income households.', 'Can a business or sector really make those productivity gains without thinking about the lives of their employees - who are, after all, key stakeholders?', 'Poverty is estimated to cost the public purse around PS78 billion a year and all businesses, like other taxpayers, have to pay part of this cost.', 'Businesses should also be concerned about the impact that poverty has on individual employee performance .', 'These findings, together with concurrent work from on pay progression and the role of corporate decision-making, mean we have a much better understanding of the key levers for influencing employer behaviour change.', 'The level of the National Living Wage became an electoral issue with both the two main political parties proposing considerable increases .', 'Ultimately though, designing business practice and policy solutions to addressing good work and productivity must connect with the everyday lives of people working on a low income and what matters to them most.', 'There is a real opportunity to drive improvements in both if good jobs become the norm.', ""The idea that healthy workers are more productive holds an intuitive appeal for anyone who has struggled through a day's work, paid or unpaid, with a heavy cold or a headache."", 'That is, there is a two-way relationship between health status and socioeconomic factors.', 'Developments such as the 2018 signal a new and welcome policy approach, recognising the role of health as a dimension of work quality.', 'The idea that we should evaluate economies in terms of their human impacts is increasingly popular.', ""Proposals for alternatives that define success by increases in wellbeing and sustainability as well as growth are gaining traction , for example in 2019 New Zealand's first was published ."", 'Will this approach to economic outputs be accompanied by a greater focus on the social inputs to prosperity, including health?', ""The link between economic deprivation and poor health is wellestablished , but interest is growing in the 'vicious circle' by which poor health in turn makes it harder to create wealth in a place."", 'Unemployment and limited employment prospects associated with ill-health and long-term conditions explain around 30% of the productivity gap between the North and the rest of England.', 'Investment to reduce this disparity could generate over PS13 billion in gross value added .', 'This is especially important for areas such as the North East, where poor outcomes on a range of health indicators are closely related to historically high levels of deprivation and the impacts of economic restructuring .', 'Life expectancy at birth for both sexes is below the English average.', 'As well as contributing to economic inactivity , this trend almost certainly means that some people who stay in work, for economic or personal reasons, will perform less effectively because of poor health.', 'However, the nature of that investment - who should make it, where it should be targeted and how its benefits can be measured - is complex.', ""In the first place, economic gains are only one of a host of reasons for investing in health services and the public health measures - the 'compelling case' for intervention also includes the intrinsic value of health, the role of health in social justice and potential savings in health service costs ."", 'In addition, the productivity impacts of health vary by condition, severity and context, as well as by type of job and sector.', ""And while absenteeism and withdrawal from the labour market are fairly straightforward categories, it is much harder to identify the effect on productivity of 'presenteeism' or working whilst unwell - although this may be substantial ."", 'Recent years have seen great gains in enabling work for people with long-term health conditions and in ending the stigma associated with certain illnesses.', 'The way we talk about health is often at odds with expert knowledge of what works to improve, create and maintain it .', 'Informal understandings tend to assume that health is shaped primarily by the individual exercise of responsibility, discipline and will, with genetic factors also playing a major role .', 'Experts argue, however, that health creation is complex, arising through multiple interactions with places, experiences and opportunities - including work itself.', 'Individual actions and choices to improve health take place in social and economic contexts, and are enabled or inhibited by these.', 'A second key context is the workplace itself; after all, this is where working adults spend a large proportion of their time.', 'Yet employer approaches to investment in the health of their workers varies considerably.', 'Multiple examples of good practice exist alongside uncertainty about how to create, prioritise and measure employee wellbeing .', 'The changing nature of work, with new patterns of employment and relationships between employers and employees, may have consequences for health at work and for the effectiveness of employer investment.', 'While more employers recognise the value, social and economic, of comprehensive changes, work insecurity is an increasing concern.', 'Not only could precarious work make engagement with workplace health more challenging, it may itself have negative impacts for health and, in turn, for productivity.', ""This could be a particular issue for certain 'low-wage' sectors, as well as for areas and industries that have seen a relatively large increase in insecure work."", 'As well as supporting wider calls for investment in health creation and prevention of illness, policy responses to improving health for productivity should focus on improving information and resources for key stakeholders who hold the powers to spearhead change.', ""Central and local government are themselves major employers and have the 'hard and soft' powers to manage the integration needed to embed health in different contexts, including the workplace."", 'National examples of good practice, particularly in relation to mental health, already exist .', 'In the North East, the a recognition that good quality work supports both productivity and health .', ""Once embedded, evaluated and widely discussed, such initiatives can help to make the case for the 'robust model for measuring and reporting on the benefits of employer investments in health and wellbeing' envisaged by Black ."", 'In time they will help to reframe health at work as a project of co-creation by employers, employees and government.', ""In the 15 years since the Timewise team began focusing on flexible working, there's been a huge evolution in both its perceived value and the attention it has received."", 'Once a hushed-up perk for a small number of maternity returners, with few champions, flexible working is now a core ingredient of workplace strategy.', 'The review spearheaded a growing understanding into the social and economic value of Good Work; that is, work that benefits individuals and society as much as businesses.', ""When you look at the business case and the impact of working flexibly on employee wellbeing and engagement , it's easy to see why."", 'Genuine, two-way flexible working, which delivers for employers and employees alike, has been shown to boost talent attraction and retention .', 'It helps drive inclusion and diversity , and supports the progression to senior level of key groups, including women.', 'Having less people in the office at the same time can also lead to savings on office space and other business overheads.', 'Flexible working also delivers better work-life balance , with the knockon effect of supporting mental and physical health and improving wellbeing.', 'Government figures have shown that in 2017-2018, 57% of all sick days were due to work-related stress, anxiety or depression; tackling these through better flexible working is clearly good for everyone involved.', 'So what about productivity?', 'Does the ability to work flexibly make you more There are some figures to suggest that this is the case.', 'Similarly, a survey from 2015 suggested that 30% of office workers felt their productivity increased when they worked remotely, and in a study of flexible workers undertaken by Cranfield , over 90% of managers said the quantity and quality of work improved or stayed the same.', ""Additionally, it is simple common sense to assume that if you're working fewer days a week, you are likely to be more engaged on those days; that if your job fits well with your life, you're likely to bring more energy to it; that working from home, with fewer interruptions, can increase your output; and that if you hang on to experienced team members, who know what they're doing, your team as a whole will deliver more, better and more efficiently."", 'These assumptions have certainly contributed to increased interest in the concept of the four-day working week.', 'In the last year there has been a swathe of articles about companies who have switched their employees onto this pattern, without any dip in productivity or loss of pay.', 'A key early example of this, Perpetual Guardian in , ran a pilot that they say revealed a 20% increase in productivity.', 'Does this mean we can all just move to a four-day week for the same money and watch our productivity soar?', ""And when talent isn't seen as a high commodity the business case for investment is hard to make."", 'Furthermore, in a shift-based environment, the concept of a four-day working week does not really fly, as employees are not working a standard five-day week.', ""What most of them really want is more control and predictability over when and how much they work, to achieve what we at Timewise term 'shift-life balance'."", ""So if the four-day week isn't the answer to increasing productivity on a large scale, what is?"", 'I would argue that there are two big steps we need to take to tackle this issue in a robust, sustainable 1.', 'More investment into designing jobs that deliver two-way flexibility If we agree in principle that two-way flexibility supports productivity, we need to make it more widespread.', 'As with the four-day working week, this is more straightforward in office-based knowledge and creative sectors than it is in shift or service-based ones in sectors such as health and social care, retail, hospitality, construction and teaching.', 'Some of whom need more control and security over their working patterns, and others more opportunities to progress into better paid part-time work to fit with caring or health reasons.', 'To drive change we will need governmentlevel investment.', ""We invest in technical innovation to support economic growth in this country; it's time we invested in job design innovation too."", 'Proper research into the impact of flexible working on productivity Once we have more models of flexible working in place, across a wider range of different sectors and role types, we will be in a far better position to research the link between flexible working and productivity.', ""By doing so, we'll create a virtuous circle in which more organisations are prepared to move to a more flexible approach, which will boost their productivity, which will in turn encourage others to follow their lead."", 'We have led a number of research projects exploring innovative flexible options in complex sectors such as social care , nursing , teaching and retail .', ""Right now, we're piloting flexible working in the construction industry and investigating the role that flexibility can play in supporting

in the highest scoring quartile have been shown to be 22% more profitable on average than those in the bottom quartile and have 21% higher productivity .', 'More analysis will help to build the evidence base, yet in the meantime, there is a huge body of research and data that confirms the evident link between the two.', 'Intuitively, we know and agree that when we treat people well, they respond in kind.', 'Yet in an age of job uncertainty, growing competition and rising workplace stress and anxiety, one in three workers report being unhappy at work.', 'Some 45% of people were looking to move jobs in 2019, and of the top three reasons given for moving on, not feeling valued and workrelated stress each scored 16%.', ""Better pay was also an issue, yet interestingly a 'good work-life balance' and a 'good team' scored higher than pay as things that people liked most about their work ."", 'The average cost of replacing a skilled worker is typically 150% of their salary, and firms with engaged employees enjoy around 40% less turnover of staff - another dimension of the productivity puzzle.', 'We need an engaging campaign that is supported by the evidence we already have and that presents a straightforward call-to-action, with a message communicated in such a way that people can engage with it easily and readily.', ""If you say 'five-a-day' to someone, there is every

decision to collect such data was made on the grounds that those who do the job are likely to have a good insight about how to improve the way they work and potentially increase the productivity of themselves and others.', 'However, the research also shows that this is where management practices have taken a backward step in recent times, with employee involvement on the decline.', 'The research reported in this essay makes two distinctive contributions .', 'The first contribution provides new data on the ways in which employees increase productivity through offering ideas and suggestions about improving work processes, products or services.', 'These new insights come from eight questions asked of 2,882 employees who took part in the survey.', ""These questions were designed to capture the willingness and ability of employees to come up with innovative ideas, and hence contribute to increased Three questions on the extent to which innovation is built into jobs such as 'developing new or improved work processes, products or services'; Two questions on the extent to which personal suggestions and initiatives taken on an individual or group basis have led to 'increases in the efficiency with which work is carried out'; and Three questions on the extent to which suggestions given by individuals, problem-solving groups and management consultation meetings have 'contributed to improvements being made to work processes, products or services'."", 'This provides external validity for our claim that these employee measures provide a new, hitherto unexplored, perspective on productivity.', 'Around half of respondents who offered suggestions about ways of improving productivity mentioned improvements in the resources needed to do the job, such as increased training, more staff and better tools and equipment.', ""The second contribution of the research is that it examines the most effective ways of tapping into employees' ideas about increasing productivity."", 'This proportion of employees reporting a great deal of say in decisions that affect the way they carry out their work has fallen from 14% in 2006 to 12% in 2017.', 'These findings corroborate previous studies on the links that training and performance monitoring have with productivity.', 'However, since we only have one crosssectional data point, the inferences we make are based on associational not causal analysis.', 'Another limitation to our approach is that unlike other studies we do not have a direct measure of productivity.', 'Furthermore, the research findings do not offer a policy panacea because there are macro- and microlevel drivers of productivity on which we do not have employee-level data.', 'These drivers include investment in physical and intangible capital, the level of spare capacity, patterns of wage growth and interest rates.', 'Although targeted government investment, in particular high-profile sectors through, for example, sector deals, might raise productivity in these sectors, it is unlikely to trigger a general levelling up of productivity across the economy.', 'On this basis, the House of Commons recently concluded that, \'The government\'s Industrial Strategy isn\'t doing enough for the ""everyday economy"", in sectors such as retail and hospitality where millions of Brits are employed\' and where - according to our data - around a third of \'low productivity enhancing jobs\' are located.', ""To really drive productivity upwards, the current 'picking sectors' approach needs to be complemented by a more generalpurpose policy response of tapping into employees' knowledge of the most effective ways of boosting productivity so that improvements come from all sectors and occupational levels."", 'Based on evidence presented in this essay a more widespread campaign is therefore needed to raise productivity, with increasing individual and collective employee voice at its core.', 'The world of work is changing, with new technologies offering opportunities for productivity growth that should lead to greater wealth, more fairly shared with workers.', 'This change means that productivity will increasingly rely on human ingenuity, with a rise in the value of intangible goods such as intellectual property.', 'But too much debate about how to realise these gains has assumed that workers will be left behind.', 'We argue that there is nothing inevitable about this extractive model of productivity; instead, productivity and good work can go hand-in-hand if workers are given a voice in shaping the nature and pace of change.', 'Understanding the links between good work and productivity requires us to understand what is being produced and how.', 'Changing models of production, from the Industrial Revolution onwards, have shaped both the nature of the work and the struggles to ensure it is decent.', 'The coming wave of technological change should be one that offers the chance to reflect on the failures of previous technological shifts to put workers first.', 'The inequality, social discontent and political upheaval that many western countries now face at least in part reflects the failure to manage past industrial transitions.', 'Perhaps most importantly, the nature of the current wave of technological change is one that increasingly emphasises the importance of workers themselves.', 'Away from the slightly hyperbolic debates about whether and when the robots will take over, economists and others are increasingly talking about how to measure the increasing contribution that ideas, innovation and trust make to economic value.', 'Taking an approach that measured our national output differently, these activities would clearly be seen as extractive rather than productive.', ""Luckily, there's nothing inevitable about a trend to ever more extractive forms of production."", 'As an increasing range of evidence shows, enabling workers to shape the way that technology and innovation are used

this short essay.', 'These, and many other philosophers, have shaped the mindsets of generations of economists, policymakers, business leaders and trade unionists.', 'Perhaps counterintuitively, then, the way to address the trade-offs between productivity and good jobs is to move from a zero-sum mindset to identifying win-wins.', 'Too many leaders act as if people were machines that unfailingly respond to commands or extrinsic incentives from above.', 'Leadership to take on the challenging task of changing established mindsets.', 'From zero-sum games to win-wins.', 'The digital technologies can be focused on producers, consumers or both.', 'Before considering each in turn, it is worth quoting some numbers that illustrate the issue.', 'Free goods are not really free - they are paid for by advertising and the data they generate and so are included in official statistics.', 'Home production of digital goods and services - for example consumers booking holidays at home rather than through travel agents - goes beyond the boundaries of national accounts and so is not included in the productivity statistics.', 'This in turn suggests a need for policies to support these firms.', 'This is the idea that many of these technologies produced at nearzero marginal cost actually benefit consumers, and that we need a new measure of economic performance that directly measures consumer welfare; one that takes account, for example, of the satisfaction consumers derive from the use of social media platforms.', 'Even more important is that these measures do not directly link to jobs or job quality.', 'A production focus is thus also needed to gauge the impact of digital technologies on jobs.', 'Automation was seen as being detrimental to routine tasks but not to those whose functions are not easily replicated by machines - mostly those in the middle range of workplace skills.', 'A more sanguine approach is one that makes use of the distinction between jobs and tasks.', 'People who carried out these tasks in the past have time freed to devote to other, more rewarding activities.', 'A theoretical perspective alone might miss barriers to best practice that would seem obvious at firm-level.', 'The restaurant has deployed a range of sensor-based technologies to measure this, including a dashboard that measures how long it takes for food to be ready from the point of making an order at the drive-through to the point of collection.', 'The dashboard does not even measure how many units go through the door, or output per hour, but rather the average time it takes the team to serve a customer.', 'But our discussion here highlighted more tensions.', ""For example, we were told how this approach, driven primarily by centrally directed targets, often creates stress for staff and that 'there is a delicate balancing act' as patient outcomes also matter."", 'These kiosks are therefore not a cost saving in terms of staff time, but have proven to be revenue generating - customers spend an average of PS1 more per order.', 'This has allowed the restaurant to serve a wider range of products.', ""Now we can operate with much greater precision'."", ""The key is to ensure that the risks and benefits of flexibility are shared by both employer and employee, thus avoiding what the defined as 'one-sided flexibility' ."", 'However, we also uncovered good work benefits.', 'Nevertheless, the emergence of these dependencies does emphasise the point that technology can potentially affect skill levels and worker autonomy through lowering the task demands or standardising job requirements.', 'The experience of this standardisation came out in some interviews.', 'At our hospital site visit we were also warned about how technology can place excessive strain on workers.', ""One representative spoke about the introduction of electronic health records and how 'this will change everything'."", 'Where the restaurant encountered problems with the roll-out of technology, training was viewed by management as something of a panacea for all performance or productivity problems.', 'Although workers agreed training was important, they shared with us several additional insights about what they felt was necessary to work productively, most of which referred to good management.', ""Good managers were described as those who were 'good at communicating' and who 'know who is best suited to different tasks and how to make the best of a bad situation'."", 'Workers also felt it was important to have adequate worker voice channels.', 'Some workers welcomed this, suggesting it made their role more enjoyable.', 'In theory, there could be a darker edge to this - where poor data is used for punitive performance management.', 'However, the management told us the data was only ever used for supportive conversations, and the workers we interviewed did not seem unduly concerned by the possibility of workplace monitoring being used in this way.', ""Similarly, at our employers' workshop, representatives from the transport sector told us about how workers were using their initiative and communicating delays on the goes against working procedure but delivers a more effective service."", 'Lacking across both sites was a sense that workers had any agency over the implementation of new technologies.', ""Based on this data we decided to automate the role and people now spend more time in client-facing roles'."", 'Some of the restaurant workers also spoke about this point.', ""In reference to individualised data, one said, 'I wouldn't mind it at all if it helped with my progression, then it's useful'."", ""And they have 'got to make sure people are paid right too' if given additional responsibilities."", 'Worker voice is seen by employers as crucial to alleviating these concerns.', ""As one workshop participant argued, 'if you're not happy with the tasks you are doing you need to be able to speak to your manager and communicate this; you need to have some control over job design'."", 'This last insight emphasises perhaps the central message of our research.', 'Therefore, if technology is to be a driver for good work and productivity, it will require a stronger focus by employers on job design.', 'In broad terms, the gig economy refers to short-term employment contracts or freelance work, as opposed to traditional, permanent jobs.', ""But it often refers more specifically to the use of online platforms for sourcing such 'gig work' ."", 'Although food delivery cyclists may be one of the most visible signs of the gig economy, in reality the type of work undertaken ranges from unskilled physical work to skilled, creative and professional work.', ""But if we are interested in allying productivity and good work within this growing economy, we need to address concerns about the vulnerability of such workers and employment practices that can amount to 'bad work'."", 'Gig work, along with other forms of atypical contracts, are at the heart of an ongoing debate about how we achieve the right balance between business flexibility and individual job security.', 'While clarity around employment status and subsequent entitlement to rights may be on the horizon with forthcoming legislation, gig workers themselves seem divided on how to get this balance.', 'Other non-legislative initiatives are also emerging to redress the balance.', 'For instance, the Labour xchange app , supported by Community, stops employers from hiring the same person more than three times, and instead suggests they offer them a permanent post.', ""Elsewhere, we are seeing an increasing number of 'WorkerTech' solutions aimed at improving access to protections and rights for gig workers."", 'This is also a problem for remote workers in more traditional workplace settings, but in the gig economy, there are the added challenges of effective awarenessraising and access to support.', ""But again much would seem to rest with choice - with those working as 'free agents' in this economy reporting greater satisfaction than those there 'out of necessity'."", 'An aspect of good work proposed by is intended to measure the nature of the relationships we have at work.', 'In the case of gig working, we know it can involve not just the absence of peers, but also the absence of identifiable line managers.', 'Performance drivers may also be narrow.', ""Wood found that algorithmic rating-based control is central to the operation of remote gig platforms and 'workers with the best scores and the most experience tend to receive more work due to the platforms' algorithmic ranking of workers within search results'."", 'This leads workers to work long hours to please the rating system and to compete with other workers potentially based anywhere in the world.', 'Similarly, the dispersion of gig workers presents problems in terms of how organisations can properly engage and communicate with them.', ""There are encouraging signs that worker voice is beginning to reinvent itself with the help of campaigning platforms such as the creation of self-organised digital communities, as outlined in research by Oxford University, has placed some of the negotiating power back in the hands of workers who can 'warn each other of bad clients, recommend good clients and attempt to influence pay'."", ""With increasing business globalisation, the prevalence of long supply chains and complex webs of contractual arrangements, there may be less of a distinction than we think between the alternative platform economy and what constitutes 'standard' work."", 'The World Bank has argued that facets of the labour markets in developed and developing countries are already converging.', 'If the future of work is to be based upon core values that can be applied across all parts of the economy, then there are three issues that need our urgent Find the right contractual status in law to protect rights and promote job security, while also recognising the importance of worker preference and selfidentification.', 'Use the right voice channels in order to amplify worker voice and representation.', 'This is an issue that goes back well

Scotland aimed at driving productivity, growth and inclusion .', ""Crucially, fair work is increasingly recognised as important by employers, employers' organisations, trade unions, campaigning and civil society organisations, fuelling a constructive and challenging debate across civic This hasn't happened overnight."", 'The fourth is that constructive engagement between key workplace stakeholders supports employers in delivering fair work.', 'Employers are at the heart of how fair work might better create value and drive productivity.', ""This is not to underestimate the potential power of regulation, but to recognise its inevitable 'bluntness' as a driver of change within widely heterogeneous businesses."", ""Whether or not individuals can access fair work isn't down to the luck, nor is it simply a reflection of their individual talents, skills, qualifications and effort."", 'Businesses even in the same sectors can - and do - make quite different decisions that shape the nature of work.', 'Of course, some employers choose business models that are in character inimical to fair work.', 'Where this is the case, more effective regulation and enforcement may be needed to make a difference, as these employers are unlikely to be responsive to persuasion and soft influence.', 'Employers as key decision makers can choose to achieve their aims through committing to fair work.', 'Fair work can drive a distinctive - and better - approach to creating value and sharing it.', 'Recent work by Findlay et al.', 'Positive choices are available to employers across all five fair work dimensions - opportunity, security, fulfilment, respect and effective voice - that can enhance business performance and productivity directly and indirectly.', 'Respectful relationships at work improve communication and social exchange, encourage idea generation and learning and can support workplace cohesion, all of which can improve performance and productivity.', 'Crucially, where employers seek out and listen to employee voice and support staff participation in decision-making at work, staff are more likely to resolve problems and conflicts, and to contribute creatively to performance.', ""Notwithstanding employers' central role, a complex ecosystem of actors and institutions can support and challenge employers to deliver fair work."", 'Policymakers can also use their influence to deter business approaches where there is little reciprocity, where workers carry the burden of risk or where negative outcomes require remedial action by the state.', 'A crucial part of the fair work agenda is to establish common cause with trade unions, consumers, campaigning organisations, civil society organisations and communities, and to increasing their engagement with businesses and other employers.', 'At its heart is an explicit recognition of the need to balance the rights and responsibilities of all workplace stakeholders and to build mutual benefit for workers, employers and society.', ""Although considerable progress has been made, there is a long way to go to achieve Scotland's ambition to be a world leading fair work nation , and delivering fair work remains challenging, requiring patience and perseverance."", 'The fair work agenda affords an enormous opportunity, but it also brings a significant responsibility for stakeholders to be creative, develop new thinking, identify new solutions and develop their own internal capability.', 'With this in mind, the former Commission to make recommendations about how to promote, strengthen and measure

nation, they may, as a by-product, raise productivity by creating a work environment where workers are willing and able to come up with new and innovative ideas .', 'This engagement led to the development of their socio-technical approach, which considered workplaces as having social and technical systems that require balancing.', 'What did they leave behind, and what should be taken forward?', 'Board project illustrates some of the key innovations of the movement, as well as the key tensions.', ""This was the Tavistock's second industrial project beginning in 1950."", ""Despite promising new technologies, productivity and morale in Britain's mines had slumped -- labour disputes were commonplace and workers were often absent."", 'The Tavistock suggested that the technical system of the mines had been prioritised above the social system, an insight that forms that basis of the socio-technical approach.', 'Labour had been inflexibly divided to suit machinery, damaging interpersonal, workplace relations and undermining the groups that had developed to cope with the acute stress of working underground.', 'The solution proposed was to form small, secure coalface working groups, skilled in multiple tasks and organised around tasks that they were able to fully complete.', 'For the Tavistock, the socio-technical approach appeared to offer a positive alternative to the oppressive focus on efficiency that stemmed from the work focused on standardising time and workflows.', 'However, the history of the Tavistock movement speaks to the difficulty of balancing these two ambitions.', 'A significant factor in this reluctance was growing pressure on the British coal industry from a rapidly expanding oil industry, which provided a strong imperative for automation, negotiated through painstaking agreement with the union.', 'This agreement traded the equality and trust of working groups for better pay for the operators of new machinery, ultimately short-circuiting the reforms.', 'Revisiting one colliery, it transpired that that the working groups had broken down after one year when management decided to move some members to a new coalface.', 'The Tavistock Institute was quick to realise it too, turning to ideas that put the participatory element of their action research approach at their core.', 'Brexit and the threat of automation are just two destabilising forces that could undercut the Good Work agenda.', 'The importance of quality work must be articulated on its own terms.', 'In practice and under pressure, job quality consistently comes into tension with the bottom line.', 'The Tavistock experiments were most often motivated by concerns over productivity and fraught industrial relations.', 'Of course, it is never quite so clear-cut, but ambiguity is not a good strategy for change.', 'With worker voice an important aspect of the Good Work agenda, it is important to be mindful of the long and complicated legacy of experiments in this space.', 'These experiments made progress beyond worker representation on company boards but encountered challenges from which we can learn - for example, only four of the 32 experiments were started on the initiative of unions.', 'Good Work builds on, and is legitimised by, a history of trial and error.', 'Some of the usual touchstones of job quality - ownership of the whole task, multi-skilled work, creativity - do not fit naturally with workplaces dominated by the technical system.', 'There is, therefore, a clear role for Good Work, and job design in particular, to ensure that the opportunities of technology are realised and the associated expectation of drudgery is not.', 'The confluence of these changes may provide fertile ground for the reorganisation of work around the principles that drove the work of the employees participating in the design of the jobs they perform; the autonomy of workers to decide how a task is performed; opportunities for progression and a sense of purpose; and work designed for continued learning.', 'We all have a story to tell of when our employer invested in some new kit and it was harder to use, added complications to our day and felt downright frustrating.', 'Second, to keep the business accountable, leaders should set, and be responsible for, targets towards technology investment and the people aspects that make it possible.', 'Third, tapping into external networks is vital for leaders to bring good technology and people strategies into their business.', 'As a result, Cumbria Crystal invested in a new ecommerce platform to widen its customer base alongside greater development opportunities for the team.', ""Thirty-five per cent have been trained in new processes and ways of working, whilst the organisation's Retail Manager has since participated in Productivity through People to help ensure that customers and the team are getting the best out of its ecommerce investment ."", 'This required

skills and strengths of their people are able to reduce staff turnover by, in some cases, as much as .', 'When it comes to developing and implementing new technology, companies need to ensure they can access the technical skills they need.', 'As many companies seek to transform, these skills are in short supply.', ""While some firms are cautiously optimistic that they will be able to hire the right

'Without it, firms face inertia as different parts of the business cannot pull towards shared objectives.', 'CEOs are overwhelmingly likely to want to improve how their business leads, develops and engages its people.', 'But too often the rest of the business does not see it.', ""Just like adopting new technology, leaders need to be front and centre in communicating and rolemodelling why people's management, engagement and development is mission critical."", 'While there is no one-size fits all, firms must start somewhere.', 'They should be incentivised and rewarded for the time they spend engaging and developing their team, with key performance indicators on people management given equal weight to their commercial objectives and linked to their reward.', 'Assess how your business is performing on people Keep track of how different parts of the organisation perform against your people targets.', 'Using external benchmarks to see how you compare to competitors can help identify how to improve.', 'However, for a number of reasons, this is not happening.', 'Indeed, it has proven a source of frustration amongst some policymakers that their efforts in developing interventions to support SMEs do not appear to hit the mark and the take up amongst SMEs remains stubbornly low.', 'There is often a general sense that policymakers do not fully understand SMEs or the realities of running a business.', 'High-quality service providers can often be obscured by the flood of offerings in the marketplace.', 'The nature of this market is that there is a very real downside for a company that receives poor-quality service, and so a business owner will often prefer not to procure any service rather than risk a negative business impact.', 'As a result, on the supply side, the largest professional services companies and many business schools prefer to focus on blue chip companies that are easier to reach and retain as a client base, thereby reducing the availability of best in class services to smaller businesses.', 'The inception of Be the Business, a government-supported and industryled initiative, can be viewed at least in part as a means of addressing these market failures.', 'By identifying what constitutes best practice in the design and delivery of management development programmes, and disseminating this information to the marketplace, we also hope to indirectly raise standards amongst suppliers.', 'The 12-month programme, run in partnership with the and Strathclyde, blends practical learning from peers and industry leaders with classroom sessions.', 'Interestingly, a core focus of the curriculum is around how leaders can engage their teams to deliver productivity boosts to their business.', 'Employees feel more involved and valued, and managers do not feel that they are solely responsible for improving company productivity.', 'The bottom line benefits have also been significant.', 'This challenge spurred a series of innovative ideas from employees in suggesting operational efficiencies.', 'This reduced journey time for employees and allowed them to focus on the engaging value-added components of their role rather than the paperwork.', 'The bad news is that the former has been in very short supply over the last decade.', 'And there are different drivers than elsewhere.', 'This exceptionalism is worth digging into.', 'The divergence we have seen between the consumer and producer deflator has also been a contributing factor.', ""Indeed, that's really the only source of decoupling in the last decade."", 'What can we draw from all of this?', 'Of course, disentangling productivity and decoupling is complex.', ""All boats can still be lifted, but for this to happen it's imperative that the tide starts rising again."", 'That will bring disruption that, in the short term at least, will disadvantage some workers more than others.', 'Business practices are part of the problem, but they can also be part of the solution to in-work poverty and loosening its grip so that workers can build decent lives for themselves and their families.', ""John works on a zero-hours contract, driving all over the North West

tweak."", 'In frontline and shift-based sectors it is far more complicated to introduce - or only possible to do so at a prohibitively high cost to the business.', 'With over five million people working in permanent shiftbased roles, it is imperative that we explore how we can achieve this for the benefit of workers and the economy.', 'That involves understanding what kinds of flexibility are most appropriate for each role or sector, changing workplace cultures to support different working patterns and increasing management capability to deliver them.', 'These are industries that face complex operational as well as cultural constraints to making two-way flexibility work.', 'But they are industries that employ millions of frontline workers who service our economy.', 'We need to test and catalyse new approaches to designing twoway flexibility in these sectors, particularly as many are struggling with skills shortages.', 'But we face both a capability and a capacity gap in understanding how to redesign work, rather than invest in another skills training programme as a way to maximise performance.', 'The figures I quoted earlier are not sufficiently up-to-date or wide-ranging; we need to do more to prove the link, particularly at a sectoral level.', ""At Timewise, we're already on this journey."", ""But we are just one organisation; and although we are

mile."", 'Few, if any would dispute that.', 'As well as being the right thing to do, providing good work is an issue for the bottom line as well.', 'We need a sustained campaign, with a compelling

4,"['Starting points matter.', 'The initial phase of the pandemic was disinflationary.', 'It is difficult to be precise about the impact of either or how temporary the effect will prove to be.', 'But some of this demand might be expected to wane as we move away from the pandemic.', 'Interestingly, and perhaps because of policy support, the pandemic and associated economic impacts have not led to some of the scarring impacts that were forecast at the outset.', ""Our Agents' survey suggests that the majority of firms are likely to pass at least some of these increases into prices over the coming year, which will add to inflationary pressure."", 'The impact of higher energy prices will not be felt evenly.', 'The rate of inflation was forecast to begin to fall back later this year and next as the increase in energy prices dropped out of the annual inflation rate and the disinflationary impact of the drop in demand took hold.', 'Inflation ended the forecast well below target.', 'But in all probability, it will intensify and prolong the surge in inflation and tighten the squeeze on household incomes.', 'Had I given it two weeks later, when the decision was announced, they would have been 10% and 17%.', 'It will feed through into consumer prices in October of this year.', 'But ahead of then we can conduct some simple thought experiments to get an idea of the direction and scale of the energy impacts alone.', 'What implications does this have for monetary policy?', 'The first and most obvious point to make here is that, given the scale of the energy price increase and the lags in monetary policy, there is little monetary policy can do to offset the externally-generated pressures on prices and hence the very high inflation numbers we are certain to see over the coming quarters.', 'Nor can monetary policy do much to offset the squeeze on household incomes that will result.', 'What we can do is to ensure that when the current, extreme pressures pass, inflation returns to its 2% target.', 'The first is ensuring that inflationary pressures do not become embedded in the domestic economy in a way that would keep inflation above target even once energy and other import prices have stopped increasing and possibly even start to decrease.', ""The risk here is that as we enter into a period of even higher inflation - higher than we have seen for 40 years - with a tight labour market and strong pay growth, expectations of permanently higher inflation begin to drive businesses' and workers' decisions - and crucially that these new norms became embedded deeply enough to withstand the contraction in economic activity and employment we are very likely to see set in around the end of this year."", 'The risk on the other side is that we amplify the impact of the squeeze on incomes and, given the lags in monetary policy, that our actions bear down on the economy as the rate of growth in imported prices subsides, taking inflation well below our target at our policy horizon.', 'This was not because I take the first risk lightly.', 'I remember also the cost of correcting it.', 'But I do not think we are yet seeing a psychology of persistently higher inflation emerge.', 'There may also now be some element of catching up with inflation that has already happened.', 'Several measures of household and business inflation expectations have risen.', 'As my colleague Silvana Tenreyro has pointed out, there is some evidence that household inflation expectations simply lag prices, particularly large increases in salient prices like petrol and food.', 'And it is those that might have the least wage bargaining power that have the most volatile expectations.', ""However, households' and businesses' norms are about to be tested by a period of even higher inflation, after the social and economic upheaval of the pandemic which may also have affected attitudes and norms more generally."", 'But although the 1970s remains a salutary lesson in what can happen, we should not talk ourselves into believing we are inevitably heading for a repeat performance.', 'It is by no means clear that, even with a period of high inflation, we would today see similar price and pay increases in a period of subdued economic activity and higher unemployment.', 'So while I recognise the risk of second-round effects and that further tightening of monetary policy might be necessary, I am not at present convinced that we will inevitably have to lean heavily and constantly against an embedding of an inflationary psychology as we progress through this challenging period and as the impact of higher commodity prices on real household incomes depresses activity.', 'Again, the starting point matters.', 'This reflects the fact that it went into the pandemic with strong capital and liquidity positions, the result of the post financial crisis reforms which included stress testing the major banks to ensure that they could withstand an extreme but plausible stress scenario.', 'Subsequent fiscal support to the economy meant that the banking system did not need to call on the buffers of capital and liquidity that had been built up.', 'But extensive and repeated stress testing during the pandemic gave us confidence that the banking system could withstand further severe waves of the pandemic even if fiscal support to the economy was absent.', ""And second, and more indirectly, through the general impact of higher inflation and lower economic activity on banks' balance sheets."", ""The Bank of England's annual stress test in 2019, which tested the system against a scenario of weak economic growth and relatively high inflation, also provides assurance here."", 'The non-bank financial system experienced major and very disruptive liquidity stress at the onset of the Covid crisis in March 2020.', 'We need to be very vigilant to these risks, as the Financial Policy Committee of the Bank has emphasised.', 'What we can do, and what you can have confidence that we will do, is to use our tools carefully and flexibly as these shocks pass through the economy and through the financial system to deliver those objectives of monetary and financial stability.']","['And it may be many years before we know whether this will be a structural, long lasting change in what is now essentially an integrated global economy.', 'But as economies recovered in fits and starts over the course of last year, supply, itself damaged by the pandemic, could not keep pace with demand.', 'The domestic labour market has also been buffeted by large changes in supply and demand as we have emerged from the pandemic.', 'It is possible that some of this weakness will prove to be structural rather than cyclical, the result of changes in work and life preferences as a result of the pandemic.', 'On the demand side there is evidence that the pandemic increased the demand for labour in some sectors, particularly health.', 'The number of employees on payrolls is now some 700,000 higher than before Covid, half of which are in health, social work, education or public administration.', 'Some of this reflects a shift away from self-employment.', 'Indeed, the number of workforce jobs in health and social work began to decline in the final quarter of 2021.', 'Unemployment, including longer term unemployment, is low.', 'Although vacancies have reached a record level, hiring has also been happening at a faster pace.', 'Rather, what we have seen in the labour market coming out of Covid has very much been a story of weak labour supply and strong labour demand.', 'This has been reflected in pay, which has been growing faster than pre pandemic rates since the final quarter of 2020.', 'The resulting squeeze on household incomes later this year and into next year was forecast at around a 2% reduction in disposable income.', 'To put that into context, it would be the biggest annual average reduction in household incomes for around three decades and would return the total to late-2018 levels.', 'These factors could amplify the hit to aggregate demand.', 'As a consequence of this hit to demand, growth in economic activity was forecast to fall back materially, in the second half of this year.', 'At the same time the labour market was forecast to remain tight in the near term with unemployment continuing to fall until the middle of this year and pay continuing to grow above 4% annually until the autumn, before the effect of the income squeeze on activity and employment kicked in to offset the pressure in the labour market.', 'The consequent drop in demand through household consumption and business investment will, to an extent not yet clear, be greater than we thought in February.', 'Ukrainian economy is smaller still.', 'And the general increase in uncertainty will weigh on both household consumption and on business investment.', 'We are starting to see the prospect of weaker demand show up in household and business surveys.', 'But forecasting the subsequent impact on household income and consumption is more complex, given it depends on the degree of substitution away from energy and the response of household saving, among other things.', 'All else equal the invasion of Ukraine will have made such an undershoot more pronounced.', 'The predominant driver of the growth we have seen in pay has been the tightness of the labour market.', 'There is also large dispersion, which suggests people form expectations in very different ways and this adds uncertainty.', 'Rather, we will need carefully to judge the risks on both sides, weighing the evidence on the evolution of domestic prices, wages, activity and employment as it emerges.', ""I want now to look briefly, and through the same lenses, at the impacts of the Russian invasion of Ukraine on financial stability - the Bank of England's other primary objective."", 'They were thus able to maintain credit to the real economy at the onset of the pandemic.', 'On the general economic impact, the current high levels of capital and liquidity provide substantial resilience.']","['This has been the underlying driver of global goods prices and, until the prospect grew of a Russian invasion of Ukraine, of the rise in global energy prices.', 'Services prices, which better reflect domestic costs , have still to regain their pre-Covid trend.', 'Labour supply has been hit by a drop in participation in the labour force and lower net migration.', 'Much will depend on the course of the conflict and the evolution of sanctions.', 'And there are also likely to be additional impacts on the supply side of the economy.', 'The impact, as we have seen over the past few months, will come primarily through commodity prices.', 'But Russia accounts for a much larger share of global commodity supply.', 'This is most apparent in energy - oil, gas and coal.', 'It is true also for industrial metals, fertilisers and agricultural commodities.', 'Ukraine is also a major supplier of the latter.', 'We have already started to see some of the effects on commodity prices, including for energy and food.', ""Sanctions have not so far been imposed on Russia's commodity exports and Russia has not imposed any direct restrictions on delivery, though pipeline flows have been lower than in recent years."", 'But commodity markets have been affected by more than the direct sanctions on Russia.', 'And, irrespective of sanctions, Russian gas supplies to Europe have declined compared to this time last year and many Western companies have voluntarily stopped transacting with Russian entities.', 'Higher and more volatile commodity prices and disruption of commodity supply chains will have an adverse impact on the supply side of the economy.', 'In my view, that will require balancing two very different risks.', 'And firms say to our Agents that they are more willing to pass cost increases into prices and, though this is more marked for goods than services, it is a noticeable departure from the pre-Covid period.', 'First, and most directly, the impact of higher and more volatile commodity prices on the financing of commodity trading and supply.', 'I will discuss the commodity channel later.', ""The uncertainty and disruption, including of financial sanctions, generated by the invasion of Ukraine, will make this shift more difficult to manage and, depending on the evolution of the conflict, more extreme investor 'flights to safety' cannot be ruled out."", 'So far, however, and despite some large moves , financial markets have in general managed the additional pressures related to the invasion in an orderly manner.', 'However, the impact has been far more pronounced commodity markets.', 'The supply and trading of commodities involves a complex system which includes producers, brokers, trading houses, speculators and end users.', 'It is tied together by a fabric of derivatives and physical supply contracts that enable the real economy participants - producers and end users - to have certainty about future prices.', 'By requiring parties to a derivative contract to put up more collateral as risk increases, and requiring them to exchange gains and losses daily rather than letting them build up, margin call protects the contract and limits counterparty credit risk.', 'While the commodities supply and trading system has been severely stressed by some of the consequences of the Russian invasion, we have not so far seen major disruption.', 'With the exception of one episode, markets have continued to operate.', 'Market participants have been able to meet margin calls, albeit with difficulty in some cases.', 'These extreme market moves were very much greater than the moves seen in the market for other industrial metals affected by the Russian invasion and clearly reflected other factors.', 'More generally, given the role they play in the real economy and the links to the financial system, we may want, when the dust has settled, to reflect on the resilience under stress of the commodity supply system, including the financial services that support it.', 'I would like to thank Andrew Bailey, Colette Bowe, Sarah their helpful comments.']","[""We do not of course know the outcome of Russia's aggression in Ukraine; there are many courses the conflict could take."", 'Lower participation has been compounded by lower migration either as a result of the pandemic or Brexit.', 'Migration data over the past two years are unreliable given the disruption of the pandemic.', 'There is no material evidence of sectoral mismatches in the labour market, which has remained highly flexible.', 'The Russian economy itself is only a small part, around 3%, of the global economy.', 'It is impossible to predict with any confidence where commodity prices in general and energy prices in particular might go.', 'The possibility of sanctions - and of Russian retaliation - has clearly driven much of the volatility in prices.', ""Financial sanctions also appear to have had a 'chilling effect' on energy related transactions with Russia."", 'While we cannot predict with certainty how these markets will evolve, it is very probable that energy and other commodity prices will be higher for longer.', 'Labour market reforms, open markets and greater competition mean firms and workers do not have the same pricing power.', 'It is, of course, indirectly exposed through relationships with banks in other jurisdictions, but though some banks in other jurisdictions have larger exposures, the aggregate risks do not appear to be high.', 'The impacts on the banking system are more likely to come through two channels.', 'The starting position of non-bank finance, the universe of investment funds, insurance companies and pension funds and the financial markets that serve and connect them, is more complex.', ""This run - the so called 'dash for cash' - was only broken by massive injections of liquidity into the system by central banks."", 'The non-bank ecosystem as a result has emerged from Covid with greater liquidity, which will help to cushion liquidity stress.', ""Moreover, although there has been substantial work to identify the causes of the 'dash for cash', the underlying liquidity fragilities have not yet been addressed."", 'It is financed by banks and non-banks and makes extensive use of market platforms and clearing houses as well as over the counter trading and hedging.', 'The financial crisis 15 years ago demonstrated what can happen when participants lose confidence in the ability of their counterparties to fulfil their contracts and when the derivative contracts that are intended to protect against risk fail.', 'Banks have continued to finance the market.', 'These markets are relatively small compared to financial markets in general.', 'However, their opacity makes it more difficult to monitor risks, and given the interconnections with the financial system it is possible that feedback loops and other mechanisms could amplify disruption, which might in turn impact both on the financial system more generally and on the real economy.', 'The episode I referred to earlier is the suspension of the market for nickel, at the London Metals Exchange for a number of days after the market price quadrupled over two days.', 'I started this speech with the global economic recovery from Covid and have ended it talking about the price of nickel.', ""If there is a theme here it is that monetary and financial stability, the Bank's twin objectives, are sometimes buffeted violently by exogenous events - a pandemic or, tragically as we see from the pictures emerging from Ukraine, by the unprovoked aggression of one country against a peaceful neighbour."", 'The Bank cannot control or shape such events.', 'The views expressed here are not necessarily those of the Bank of England, the Monetary help in preparing the text.']"
5,"['And, if it can, what if anything should it do about them?', 'By way of background, I note that monetary policy in the United States has achieved quite a good record over the past two decades.', ""Since the Fed's conquest of inflation in the 1980s, the American economy has moved steadily toward price stability and--except for two recessions that appear to have been relatively mild by historical standards--has enjoyed solid economic growth and high employment as well."", 'Quarter-to-quarter volatility in both output growth and inflation has dropped markedly in the past twenty years, in comparison with the turbulent 1960s and 1970s.', 'The decline in stock values since March 2000 has not only vaporized trillions of dollars in wealth, but also likely played a role in worsening the recession that, according to the National Bureau of Economic Research, began in the United States in March 2001.', 'This experience has led a number of observers--including academics, journalists, and businesspeople--to assert that the Federal Reserve should have acted earlier to contain the sharp run-up in stock prices.', 'If the Fed had had the foresight to ""prick the bubble"" at an early stage, the argument goes, the economy might have been spared needless trauma.', 'My goal today is to look more closely at this argument and its implications.', ""As a preliminary to assessing the critics' argument, and to get my own views on the table right away, let me briefly sketch a policy framework that I believe is useful for thinking about these issues."", 'Before I do so, I will state the usual proviso, that the opinions expressed here are mine alone and not necessarily those of my colleagues at the Federal Reserve.', 'My suggested framework for Fed policy regarding asset-market instability can be summarized by the adage, Use the right tool for the job .', 'As you know, the Fed has two broad sets of responsibilities.', 'First, the Fed has a mandate from the Congress to promote a healthy economy--specifically, maximum sustainable employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates.', 'Second, since its founding the Fed has been entrusted with the responsibility of helping to ensure the stability of the financial system.', ""And, second, the Fed has a range of powers with respect to financial institutions, including rule-making powers, supervisory oversight, and a lender-of-last resort function made operational by the Fed's ability to lend through its discount window."", 'By using the right tool for the job, I mean that, as a general rule, the Fed will do best by focusing its monetary policy instruments on achieving its macro goals--price stability and maximum sustainable employment--while using its regulatory, supervisory, and lender-of-last resort powers to help ensure financial stability.', 'Let me discuss the two parts of this recommendation in a bit more detail.', 'The first part of the prescription implies that the Fed should use monetary policy to target the economy, not the asset markets.', 'As I will argue today, I think for the Fed to be an ""arbiter of security speculation or values"" is neither desirable nor feasible.', 'Of course, to do its job the Fed must monitor financial markets intensively and continuously.', 'Moreover, asset prices contain an enormous amount of useful and timely information about developments in the broader economy, information that should certainly be taken into account in the setting of monetary policy.', 'For example, to the extent that a stock-market boom causes, or simply forecasts, sharply higher spending on consumer goods and new capital, it may indicate incipient inflationary pressures.', 'Policy tightening might therefore be called for--but to contain the incipient inflation not to arrest the stock-market boom per se.', 'The second part of my prescription is for the Fed to use its regulatory, supervisory, and lender-of-last-resort powers to protect and defend the financial system.', 'In particular, alone and in concert with other agencies, the Fed should ensure that financial institutions and markets are well prepared for the contingency of a large shock to asset prices.', 'The Fed and other regulators should insist that banks be well capitalized and well diversified and that they stress-test their portfolios against a wide range of scenarios.', 'The Fed can also contribute to reducing the probability of boom-and-bust cycles occurring in the first place, by supporting such objectives as more-transparent accounting and disclosure practices and working to improve the financial literacy and competence of investors.', ""Finally, if a sudden correction in asset prices does occur, the Fed's first responsibility is to do its part to ensure the integrity of the financial infrastructure--in particular, the payments system and the systems for settling trades of securities and other financial instruments."", 'If necessary, the Fed should provide ample liquidity until the immediate crisis has passed.', ""The Fed's response to the 1987 stock market break is a good example of what I have in mind."", 'I have expressed these two principles in rather simple terms; they could be elaborated much further.', 'Finally, and crucially, it is a robust strategy, in that--although it certainly does not eliminate all economic and financial instability--it protects the economy against truly disastrous outcomes, which history has shown are possible when monetary policy goes severely off the track.', 'As I noted at the beginning, however, the framework just articulated is not universally accepted, particularly the aspect that precludes attempts to guide the course of asset prices.', 'Instead, a number of critics have argued that monetary policy should be more proactive in trying to correct incipient ""imbalances"" in asset markets.', 'What can be said about these assertions?', 'This debate is clarified considerably, in my view, by recognition that, in practice, the advocates of a more vigorous monetary policy response to asset prices fall into two broad camps, differing primarily in how aggressive they think the Fed ought to be in attacking putative bubbles.', 'The first group, who favor what I will call the lean-against-the-bubble strategy, agree that the Fed should take account of and respond to the implications of asset-price changes for its macro goal variables.', 'But also, according to this view, the Fed should try to gently steer asset prices away from a presumed bubble path.', 'For example, seeing a rapid appreciation of stock prices, not only should the Fed tighten enough to offset the likely effects of the boom on inflation and output, but also it should add another 25 to 50 basis points for good measure, in the hope of discouraging increases in stock prices it judges to be excessive.', 'My sense is that this more moderate camp comprises the great majority of serious researchers who have advocated a monetary-policy response to bubbles.', 'And, in my opinion, the theoretical arguments that have been made for the lean-against-the-bubble strategy are not entirely without merit.', 'At the risk of oversimplifying a large body of literature, I think one can usefully boil down many of these arguments to the idea that it may be worthwhile for the Fed to take out a little ""insurance,"" so to speak, against the formation of an asset-price bubble and its potentially adverse effects.', 'But, as a matter of theory, it is rarely the case in economics that the optimal amount of insurance in any situation is zero.', ""On that principle, proponents of leaning against the bubble have argued that completely ignoring incipient potential bubbles, if in fact they can be identified, can't possibly be the best policy."", 'I will discuss below why I believe that, nevertheless, ""leaning against the bubble"" is unlikely to be productive in practice.', 'The second group of critics is those preferring a more activist approach, which I will call here aggressive bubble popping .', 'Aggressive bubble-poppers would like to see the Fed raise interest rates vigorously and proactively to eliminate potential bubbles in asset prices.', 'But as a practical matter, this is easier said than done, particularly if we intend to use monetary policy as the instrument, for two main reasons.', 'First, the Fed cannot reliably identify bubbles in asset prices.', 'Second, even if it could identify bubbles, monetary policy is far too blunt a tool for effective use against them.', 'Aspiring bubble poppers cannot get around the fact that their strategy requires identifying bubbles as they occur, preferably quite early on.', 'Identifying a bubble in progress is intrinsically difficult.', 'Thus, to declare that a bubble exists, the Fed must not only be able to accurately estimate the unobservable fundamentals underlying equity valuations, it must have confidence that it can do so better than the financial professionals whose collective information is reflected in asset-market prices.', 'I do not think this expectation is realistic, even for the Federal Reserve.', 'Moreover, I worry about the effects on the long-run stability and efficiency of our financial system if the Fed attempts to substitute its judgments for those of the market.', ""Such a regime would only increase the unhealthy tendency of investors to pay more attention to rumors about policymakers' attitudes than to the economic fundamentals that by rights should determine the allocation of capital."", 'If we nevertheless persist in trying to measure bubbles, what indicators might be useful?', 'None of these provides a reliable indicator of a developing bubble.', 'This view is simplistic at best.', 'But even these are far from reliable--for a host of reasons, including changes in institutions, tax and accounting procedures, inflation, and underlying growth rates.', 'Economists have an extraordinarily poor understanding of the determinants of the equity premium, yet relatively small changes in this variable can have major effects on assessments of fundamental values.', 'I will give one illustration of the potential pitfalls of relying too heavily on ratio indicators, even in the hands of the most sophisticated practitioners.', 'In December 1996, before my time at the Board, John Campbell of Harvard and Robert Shiller of Yale made a presentation at the Fed, in which they used dividend-price ratios and related measures to argue that the stock market was overvalued.', 'Part of the reason that the standard ratios were too pessimistic in 1997 was that at least some of the run-up in stock prices in the latter 1990s was apparently justified by fundamentals, as evidenced by the remarkable growth in output and productivity in recent years, the recent recession notwithstanding.', 'So the problem of a bubble-popping Fed is much tougher than just deciding whether or not a bubble exists; to follow this strategy, the Fed must also assess the portion of the increase in asset prices that is justified by fundamentals and the part that is not.', 'Bubbles of this type may be identifiable to some extent after they have begun, but the right policy is to do the financial deregulation correctly--that is, in a way that does not allow speculative misuse of the safety net--in the first place.', 'To evaluate this argument, we must keep in mind an underlying premise of the lean-against-the-bubble strategists, which is that the response of incipient bubbles to monetary policy is more or less proportional to the policy action.', 'In other words, for the insurance argument to apply, a small increase in the federal funds rate must lead to some correspondingly modest decline in the likelihood or size of a bubble.', 'All we can conclude with much confidence is that the rate hike will tend to weaken the macroeconomic fundamentals through the usual channels, while the asset bubble, if there is one, may well proceed unchecked.', 'Although neither I nor anyone else knows for sure, my suspicion is that bubbles can normally be arrested only by an increase in interest rates sharp enough to materially slow the whole economy.', 'In short, we cannot practice ""safe popping,"" at least not with the blunt tool of monetary policy.', 'Certainly there is no way to direct the effects of monetary policy at a single class of assets while leaving other financial markets and the broader economy untouched.', 'One might as well try to perform brain surgery with a sledgehammer.', 'The problem of safe popping applies with double force to the aggressive bubble-popping strategy.', 'A truly vigorous attempt by a central bank to rein in a supposed speculative bubble may well succeed but only at the risk of throttling a legitimate economic boom or, worse, throwing the whole economy into depression.', 'As early as the mid-1920s, however, various policymakers and commentators expressed concern about the rapidly rising stock market and sought so-called corrective action by the Federal Reserve.', 'The corrective action was not forthcoming, however.', 'Strong resisted attempts to aim monetary policy at the stock market, arguing that raising interest rates sufficiently to slow the market would have highly adverse effects on the rest of the economy.', 'Miller was supported in his objective by another fervent enemy of ""speculation""--and Miller\'s neighbor and close friend--Herbert Hoover, soon to be President.', ""Under Miller's influence the debate within the Federal Reserve System shifted from whether to try to stop stock-market speculation to how best to do it."", 'The Board in Washington favored ""direct pressure,"" which in practice meant threatening New York City banks that made loans to brokers with being cut off from the discount window.', 'Hence, in 1928, in a situation in which the inflation rate was actually slightly negative and the economy was only barely emerging from a mild recession, the Fed began to raise interest rates.', 'In fact, the weight of historical research has shown that this interpretation gets the causality largely backward.', 'The correct interpretation of the 1920s, then, is not the popular one--that the stock market got overvalued, crashed, and caused a Great Depression.', 'The true story is that monetary policy tried overzealously to stop the rise in stock prices.', 'But the main effect of the tight monetary policy, as Benjamin Strong had predicted, was to slow the economy--both domestically and, through the workings of the gold standard, abroad.', 'This interpretation of the events of the late 1920s is shared by the most knowledgeable students of the period, including Keynes, Friedman and Schwartz, and other leading scholars of both the Depression era and today.', 'New York Fed Governor Harrison and other participants argued after the fact that the problem with their policy was not that they tried to burst the stock-market bubble but that their efforts were too little and too late.', ""This attempt to defend the Fed's policies of the latter 1920s does not hold up."", 'The Federal Reserve went on to make a number of serious additional mistakes that deepened and extended the Great Depression of the 1930s.', 'Besides trying to pop the stock market bubble, the Fed made little or no effort to protect the banking system from depositor runs and panics.', 'Most seriously, it permitted a severe deflation in the price level, which drove real interest rates sky-high and greatly increased the pressure on debtors.', 'A small compensation for the enormous tragedy of the Great Depression is that we learned some valuable lessons about central banking.', 'Understandably, as a society, we would like to find ways to mitigate the potential instabilities associated with asset-price booms and busts.', 'Monetary policy is not a useful tool for achieving this objective, however.', 'Even putting aside the great difficulty of identifying bubbles in asset prices, monetary policy cannot be directed finely enough to guide asset prices without risking severe collateral damage to the economy.', 'A far better approach, I believe, is to use micro-level policies to reduce the incidence of bubbles and to protect the financial system against their effects.', 'Because equity valuations may pose asymmetric risks to the economic forecast, the implied optimal responses of policy to changes in asset prices may be nonlinear.', ""Return to text In this regard, some have suggested greater use of the Fed's ability to set margin requirements."", 'A better strategy is for the Fed to be transparent and direct in stating its assessment of the economy and of policy options.', 'To clarify this point, support of the financial system in a crisis does not by any means imply a generalized bailout of threatened, firms.', 'Any support that is given should be done under conditions that minimize potential moral hazards.', 'The 1987 stock market crash is a real-world example of how monetary policy aimed at macro stability coupled with other types of policy emphasizing financial stability can minimize the economic fallout of a sharp decline in asset

looking at the broader trends in Australia's economic situation and examining the implications they have for the stance of monetary policy going forward."", 'Notwithstanding these concerns, it needs to be emphasised that monetary policy cannot be expected to target a particular composition of growth or current account defi cit.', 'One factor behind this was the increased focus on infl ation control by central banks around the world, after the high infl ation of the 1970s and 1980s.', 'Many central banks have now adopted numerical infl ation targets and others have clearly become more focused on infl ation control even without adopting explicit targets.', 'Nationwide house prices have been broadly fl at over the past two years and prices have fallen in Sydney.', 'This is a longer-run issue and one on which it is more diffi cult to make fi rm judgments.', 'Simple rules of thumb would suggest that this cannot be sustained indefi nitely.', 'In a low-infl ation environment, nominal interest rates are also low, and households are able to service much higher levels of debt than they could in the past.', 'The risk, of course, is that the process goes too far and that a painful correction ensues.', 'There has been much debate around the world about the role of monetary policy in these circumstances, with the consensus being that the best it can do is to continue to pursue the general objectives of macroeconomic stability and low infl ation.', 'These are matters in which prudential regulators are taking a strong interest.', ""Australia's infl ation performance over the past decade or so has been consistent with the Bank's medium-term target."", 'Of course, the infl ation rate has inevitably fl uctuated quite a bit from year to year, including periods where it has been above 3 and below 2.', ""But it should be remembered that the Bank's objective is expressed in terms of average outcomes, and should not be thought of as a rigid commitment to eliminate short-term fl uctuations in infl ation."", 'While infl ation has remained contained over the past decade it is important, as always, to consider how infl ationary pressures might evolve from here.', 'At the current stage of the expansion there are a number of factors that might be expected to put upward pressure on infl ation.', 'These conditions underpin the current forecast of a modest rise in underlying infl ation over the year ahead.', 'This outlook is, as usual, subject to signifi cant uncertainty.', 'One area of uncertainty relates to wages growth, where there is a risk that current labour market tightness will result in higherthan-expected wage increases.', 'There are also some tentative signs that conditions in the labour market are easing.', 'The issue over the period ahead will be whether these latter forces prove suffi cient to contain infl ation in an economy operating with little spare capacity.', ""In these circumstances, the Board at its recent meeting judged the current policy setting to be broadly consistent with the economy's requirements for the time being.""]","['It is a pleasure to be back here again in front of the Committee, and to be having this hearing in Canberra for the fi rst time in a number of years.', ""I will take as a starting point Australia's current economic expansion."", 'For years I have made the point that progress in winding back economic slack is made not by high growth in any individual year, but by maintaining an expansion over a sustained period.', ""Australia's current expansion began in late 1991 and is now in its fi fteenth year."", 'This means that it is already signifi cantly longer than its predecessors in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s.', 'A consequence of the sustained expansion is that the economic slack generated in the last recession has been gradually used up.', 'One indicator of this is the unemployment rate, which has trended down from a peak of 11 per cent in 1993 to be currently just over 5 per cent.', ""Other indicators of the economy's capacity utilisation are also at cyclically high levels."", 'Business surveys report that businesses are operating at close to their highest levels of capacity utilisation since the late 1980s.', 'The surveys have also been reporting high levels of labour scarcity.', 'Given the maturity of the expansion it should not be surprising if the average growth of the economy is now less than it was in the earlier stages.', ""As a general principle, it is easier for an economy to grow quickly when there is a large pool of unused resources to be re-employed, and in Australia's current position in the cycle, that source of growth is now much more limited."", 'Business investment has been a major driver of growth in recent years, expanding by 18 per cent over the past year, and at an average annual rate of 14 per cent over the past three years.', 'While the overall growth of the economy during the current expansion has been good, there has been concern expressed about its composition.', ""In particular, the growth of the economy over the past few years has been more than fully accounted for by growth in domestic spending, while Australia's export performance has been disappointing."", 'That is, there has been a reasonably high correlation in the timing of recessions and expansions among developed countries over the past few decades.', 'Most of the advanced countries experienced recessions in the mid 1970s, the early 1980s and the early 1990s, and many did so in 2001.', ""It is relatively unusual for countries in this group to experience what might be termed a 'home-grown' recession, that is, a recession not shared by the major industrial countries."", 'Similarly, it is fairly unusual for countries to skip an international recession, though Australia and some other countries have recently done so, as did Japan in the early 1980s.', 'This is not to say that domestic conditions and policies are unimportant.', 'Nevertheless, as a general rule, when the world economy as a whole is in a sustained expansion, there is a good chance that an expansion will also be continuing in an economy such as Australia.', 'Currently the world economy is expanding strongly.', 'The recovery from the global downturn in 2001 is now well established and, on past experience, the expansion should still have some way to run.', 'While growth to date has been led mainly by the United States and China, there have been encouraging signs over the past year that growth is becoming very broadly based, with conditions improving in Japan as well as in a number of other economies.', 'However, there is little sign that these forces are restricting growth at present.', 'This growth performance has been accompanied by generally subdued infl ation outcomes.', 'Currently Australia is benefi ting from the largest cumulative increase in our terms of trade since the early 1970s.', 'The main factor driving this has been the rapid growth in global demand for resources, with China in particular contributing strongly.', 'The economic effects can be seen in a number of areas including strong growth in business investment, company profi ts, share prices and imports.', 'It did this in fi ve steps over three years - two in mid 2002, two in late 2003 and one in early 2005 - a more gradual tightening cycle than normal.', 'Of the major countries, the United States was the fi rst to raise rates, with the Fed beginning to tighten in mid 2004.', 'Although various explanations have been put forward for this unusual behaviour, the most likely cause is an ex ante excess supply of savings relative to investment around the world, with Asia accounting for a large part of the excess global savings.', 'It was affected much less than most markets by the tech bubble and the subsequent collapse, and in recent years has been rising faster than average.', 'A key to understanding the different behaviour on this occasion is the change in the interest differential with the United States.', 'In recent years we have given a lot of attention to the growth of household debt and its possible effects on the macro economy.', 'Regarding the fi rst of these issues, the most recent cyclical peak in household credit growth occurred around the end of 2003, when it reached an annual rate of over 20 per cent.', 'Since the bulk of household borrowing is housing-related, it is not surprising that this phenomenon was closely associated with a sharp run-up in house prices.', 'Nationwide house prices increased strongly for several years up to late 2003, reaching a peak growth rate of around 20 per cent in that year.', 'The increases in credit and house prices were inter-related, with credit availability fuelling the price rises, while rising house prices meant people had to borrow larger amounts to achieve home ownership.', 'Much of this behaviour was driven by expectations, particularly in the investor market, of future price gains - the classic defi nition of bubble-like behaviour.', 'In the period since late 2003, both the housing market and the demand for credit have cooled.', 'Household credit growth has eased back to an annual rate of around 12 per cent.', 'Although this might still be regarded as quite high in absolute terms, it is towards the lower end of the range in which it has fl uctuated in the past two decades.', 'While there are some tentative signs that credit and housing market conditions have fi rmed a little in recent months, the risks to the economy posed by the over-heating in housing and credit markets in the period up to late 2003 have eased.', 'Households now seem to have entered a period of greater fi nancial caution, and this may act as a restraining infl uence on the growth of household spending for a while to come.', 'The second issue is the high average growth rate of household credit over an extended period.', 'For more than a decade, household indebtedness has grown at a rate well in excess of the growth in household incomes.', 'Yet there are a number of reasons why these ratios may rise further.', 'A signifi cant proportion of households still carry little or no debt, and in the years ahead might choose to borrow more.', 'Attitudes towards borrowing appear to be changing, with people becoming more willing to borrow against assets later in life.', 'For these and other reasons, it is quite possible that the rise in household debt ratios could go a good distance further.', 'While the growth of household borrowing has been relatively high throughout the current expansion, business borrowing on average has been more restrained.', 'This is the reverse of the pattern that was observed in the 1980s and, as a result, the business sector generally is in good fi nancial shape with low levels of debt.', 'In the past two or three years businesses have begun to take advantage of that position by again expanding their borrowing and lifting the rate of growth in their investment spending.', 'Business credit has thus strengthened quite markedly, so that it is now growing at a rate of 16 per cent, well above that for the household sector.', 'The economy is operating at a high level of capacity utilisation, the labour market is relatively tight, and there have been some large increases in raw materials costs.', 'Aggregate wages growth has picked up over the past year, and businesses generally are reporting diffi culty in attracting labour.', 'This will be an important area to watch in the months ahead.']","['I note that the membership of the Committee has changed again, particularly on the Government side.', ""That is something that has happened pretty well continuously in the nearly ten years I have been reporting to it under the current arrangements, but it has not interfered with the Committee's effectiveness."", 'As you know, we had our February Board Meeting last week and we issued our quarterly earlier this week.', 'For the past year or so, many businesses have been in the unusual position of reporting that scarcity of suitable labour was a bigger constraint on their activities than their traditional concerns about the adequacy of demand or sales.', 'The upswing in business investment is being stimulated by high commodity prices and favourable fi nancial conditions.', ""Australia's economic situation should also be viewed against the backdrop of the global business cycle."", 'In broad terms, business cycles across various countries have tended to move together, at least among countries in the developed world.', 'At the same time, the importance of structural factors, and particularly the industrialisation of China, should be recognised.', 'The huge pool of low-cost labour that this has brought into play has put sustained downward pressure on a wide range of prices of internationally traded goods.', ""One consequence of these developments has been a marked upswing in Australia's terms of trade, defi ned as the ratio of our export to import prices."", 'As a result, world prices for a wide range of resource commodities have been increasing sharply.', ""Over the past three years Australia's terms of trade have increased by around 30 per cent."", 'Increased export prices also tend to boost government revenues through company taxes and a range of federal and state royalties.', 'There is therefore a sense that the current level is relatively neutral in terms of its impact on economic activity and infl ation.', 'This has narrowed appreciably over the past 18 months because the Fed has tightened much more than we have.', 'We should also not forget infl uences on the supply side.', 'Banks and other providers of credit to households have been competing vigorously to expand or protect their market share.', 'In the process, lending standards have been progressively eroded so that lenders are now engaging in practices that would have been regarded as out of the question fi ve or ten years ago.']","['In mid 2002, with both domestic and global economic conditions improving, the Bank began the process of restoring offi cial interest rates to more normal levels.', ""One complication in assessing the level of interest rates, however, is that competition in the fi nancial sector has seen margins between the cash rate and institutions' lending rates narrow over recent years, so the interest rates faced by borrowers are still a little below average."", 'Australia moved to restore normal interest rates well ahead of other developed economies.', 'All the major countries had reduced interest rates to unprecedented levels in the early part of this decade - 0 per cent in Japan, 1 per cent in the United States and 2 per cent in the euro area - and they maintained this position for a prolonged period.', 'The European Central Bank has only just started the process in recent months and the Bank of Japan is not expected to start lifting rates for some time yet.', 'Another unusual aspect of current global interest rates is that long-term rates, which are set by the demand for and supply of funds in capital markets, have remained quite low in the face of rising offi cial interest rates.', 'For equity markets, the combination of low interest rates, strong economic growth and low infl ation has proved very benefi cial, with global share markets rising solidly in each of the past three years.', 'It is worth noting that the Australian share market has behaved quite differently from the global market over the past decade.', 'Along with the Canadian share market, it is the only major market that is currently above earlier peak levels, whereas in Europe and the United States share markets are still about 20 per cent below their early 2000 peaks.', 'Some people have found this steadiness puzzling against the background of very strong rises in commodity prices and the terms of trade, as such episodes in the past have been associated with strong rises in the currency.', 'Looking ahead, however, it felt that on balance, based on the considerations I have outlined here today, it is more likely that the next move in interest rates would be up rather than down.']"

namely, the government's intention to introduce fiscal measures to stimulate the economy."", 'Our convention is not to guess about these things, but to incorporate actual announcements.', 'It is fair to say, therefore, that our deliberations began with a bias toward further monetary easing.', 'However, we must be mindful of the risk that a further rapid depreciation could push overall inflation higher relatively quickly.', 'Even if this is temporary, it might influence inflation expectations.', 'Governing Council continues to see the underlying trend in inflation as somewhat below 2 per cent, given the persistent, and recently widening, slack in the economy.', 'Inflation expectations remain well anchored at about 2 per cent.', 'With the economy expected to resume above-potential growth in the near term, our expectation is that inflation will converge on 2 per cent as the output gap closes and the temporary effects of low oil prices and past exchange rate depreciation dissipate.', 'That will mean the continuation of a two-track economy, with the resource sector shrinking and other sectors picking up speed, all facilitated by a lower Canadian dollar and supported by very stimulative monetary policy.', 'While that adjustment process sounds mechanical, in fact, it is personal.', 'Monetary and fiscal policies can help to buffer some of these effects, and help speed up the process by fostering growth in other sectors of the economy, but the adjustment must ultimately take place.', 'In this context, as complex and uncertain as our situation is, Governing Council decided that the current stance of monetary policy remains appropriate.', 'Her official end-date is January 31st.', 'We will miss having her in Governing Council, and wish her well.']","['Governor of the Bank of Canada Press conference following the release of the Good morning, and thank you for coming today.', 'At the global level, 2015 was a little disappointing as the world dealt with diverging economic prospects and shifting terms of trade, but we expect gradual strengthening to resume in 2016.', ""However, it was Governing Council's judgment that China will remain on its transition to a more balanced and sustainable growth path, from around 7 per cent annual growth to around 6 per cent."", 'Our global outlook remains positive, albeit cautiously so.', 'Not coincidentally, the Canadian economy appears to have stalled in the fourth quarter.', 'That is a lot of structural change.', 'One implication is that it may take up to three years for the full economic impact to be felt, and even longer for all of the structural adjustments to take place.', 'The bigger change in our projection comes from the impact of even lower oil prices on Canadian income.', ""As one measure of this change, our base case forecast suggests that it will now take longer to absorb the economy's excess capacity--probably until late 2017, perhaps later."", 'Nevertheless, we expect growth to exceed potential through most of 2016 and 2017, so the gap should be substantially closed by late 2017.', 'Suffice it to say that were we to incorporate a degree of new fiscal stimulus in this projection today the output gap would close sooner than in our base case, but how much sooner would depend on the scale and nature of the fiscal measures.', 'This is a temporary effect, and is currently being offset by lower fuel prices--another temporary effect.', 'Although the economy may grow more slowly than we would like during that transition, it can still achieve above-potential growth and absorb its excess  capacity.', 'We are encouraged by the resilience and flexibility of the Canadian economy as signs of adjustment are already evident.']","['Nevertheless, the global equity-market correction may inject a further measure of caution into business decision making.', 'We are publishing a discussion paper today that offers additional analysis of this process.', 'To summarize, the drop in oil and other commodity prices constitutes a significant setback for the Canadian economy, and has set in motion a protracted adjustment process.', 'It is disrupting the lives of many Canadians, whether through job losses or through higher prices for imported goods.', 'These are all positives that should be recognized.', ""With that, I'll now be happy to take your questions.""]","['There has been considerable attention paid to recent developments in China, and this has added to volatility in global financial and commodity markets.', 'Volatility in equity markets is, of course, not always a reflection of weak economic fundamentals.', ""Let's remember that it typically takes up to two years for the full effect of a lower dollar to be felt."", 'Second, past exchange rate depreciation is already adding around 1 percentage point to our inflation rate.', 'Let me conclude by saying publicly ""au revoir"" to our good friend and colleague, Deputy Governor Agathe Cote, who served the Bank with distinction for over 32 years.']"
9,"['By comparison, it features in only about 2% of speeches by governors of the Federal Reserve.', 'Our strong focus on structural reforms is not because they have been ignored in recent years.', 'Rather, if we talk often about structural reforms it is because we know that our ability to bring about a lasting return of stability and prosperity does not rely only on cyclical policies - including monetary policy - but also on structural policies.', 'This is because, faced with a negative demand shock, a more flexible economy will tend to react by immediately lowering prices, but agents will then expect inflation to rise again as the shock fades, ensuring a firm anchoring of inflation expectations.', 'By contrast, an inflexible economy is more likely to adjust through higher unemployment, which exerts a more prolonged downward pressure on inflation and is therefore more likely to weigh on inflation expectations.', 'Several countries have however made significant progress with structural reforms during the crisis, and we can already see how this has altered the relationship between inflation and unemployment.', 'In particular, there is evidence that inflation has become increasingly responsive to cyclical conditions in countries that have reformed their product and labour markets, such as Spain and Italy .', 'This is problematic for at least three reasons.', 'Third, low potential growth can have a direct impact on the tools available to monetary policy to deliver its mandate.', 'This materially increases the likelihood that central bank policy runs into the constraint set by the effective lower bound for interest rates, which is not far below zero.', 'It therefore also increases the likelihood that we have to resort recurrently to unconventional policies to meet our mandate.', 'When in 2003 we clarified our objective to keep inflation below but close to 2%, we assumed an equilibrium real interest rate of 2% on average.', 'The probability of hitting the effective lower bound under this assumption was very low.', 'In this context, higher potential growth would facilitate the stabilisation task of monetary policy by allowing the equilibrium real rate to rise.', 'There are many other examples one could give.', 'However, while most of us might agree with this statement in normal times, the fact that interest rates have reached the effective lower bound, coupled with the still fragile cyclical situation, makes the situation less straightforward.', 'In particular, the question has been raised as to whether implementing structural reforms when the economy is still weak would be counterproductive, in the sense that it would make it harder to achieve our mandate by further reducing short-term demand.', 'One argument that has been put forward in this context is that, if reforms lead to a credible increase in aggregate supply, they will exert downward pressure on inflation expectations.', 'And if nominal interest rates cannot fall because monetary policy is at the lower bound, real interest rates will then rise, creating contractionary short-term effects.', 'There is some empirical foundation to these concerns.', 'I would however reject the conclusion that this means all structural reforms should be postponed.', 'First, if reforms are their positive effects on short-term demand, via confidence, can more than compensate for any negative effects on inflation via increased supply.', 'It can therefore in no way be construed as being detrimental to our monetary policy objective.', 'And these findings hold even under the assumption that monetary policy is constrained.', 'Contrary to models in the literature, monetary policy is not constrained because we have reached the lower bound.', 'Rather, as I laid out in a recent speech in Washington, I think we have demonstrated in recent months how effective monetary policy can be when it has to resort to unconventional measures.', 'What has been constrained in the euro area in recent years is fiscal policy, as some countries faced a loss or near loss of market access.', 'But we should remember that, in these circumstances, structural reforms are in fact crucial to support fiscal stabilisation.', 'In any event, demand is today being meaningfully buttressed in the short-term by monetary policy, and the stance of fiscal policy is broadly neutral.', 'The arguments for postponing structural reform therefore become less convincing still.', 'Any reforms undertaken now will in fact have an with macroeconomic stabilisation policies.', 'In this context, the combination of our interest rate and credit easing policy, together with the recently completed Comprehensive Assessment of bank balance sheets, can be seen as creating the ideal conditions for reforms to succeed.', 'By bringing real interest rates well below the medium-term growth rate, this policy package is creating strong price incentives to invest.', 'In this way, accommodative monetary policy supports structural reform by ensuring that the investment and employment benefits materialise faster.', 'And structural reform, by reducing uncertainty about the future macro- and microeconomic outlook, supports monetary policy by releasing the pent-up investment demand that accommodative policy creates.', 'It should therefore be clear that the argument that accommodative monetary policy constitutes an excuse for governments and parliaments to postpone their reform efforts is incorrect.', 'In fact, I would submit it actually makes reforms less socially and politically costly, as it reduces the time it takes for reforms to produce positive effects.', 'Monetary policy is working its way through the economy.', 'And inflation expectations have recovered from their trough.', 'Monetary policy can steer the economy back to its potential.']","['And second, to underline why being in the early phases of a cyclical recovery is not a reason to postpone structural reforms; it is in fact an opportunity to accelerate them.', 'Structural reforms are, in my view, best defined as policies that permanently and positively alter the supply-side of the economy.', 'And second, they make economies more resilient to economic shocks by facilitating price and wage flexibility and the swift reallocation of resources within and across sectors.', 'An economy that rebounds faster after a shock is an economy that grows more over time, as it suffers from lower hysteresis effects.', 'And the same structural reforms will often increase both short-term flexibility and long-term growth.', 'For example, reforms aimed at encouraging reallocation will not only support faster adjustment, but also higher productivity through raising allocative efficiency.', 'Reforms aimed at strengthening competition will not just encourage greater price flexibility, but also higher investment as young firms are able to enter new markets and expand more quickly.', 'A comprehensive package of structural reforms will therefore tend to increase both and .', 'This implies that economies with insufficient flexibility risk more prolonged disinflation, consistently higher unemployment, and over time, permanent economic divergence.', 'Various estimates of the euro area Phillips curve show that, while the slope has varied over time, it has steepened in recent years.', 'This is related to their effect on growth - or more specifically, the challenges posed by a period of low potential growth.', 'This is in part a result of the effects of the crisis on investment and, via hysteresis, structural unemployment.', 'But it also reflects weak underlying trends in productivity growth and labour supply.', 'Consequently, while some of the effects of the crisis on investment and employment are expected to unwind, potential growth is projected to remain well below pre-crisis growth rates.', 'A significant share of the economic losses suffered across countries would therefore become permanent.', 'Structural unemployment would stay around 10%.', 'Youth unemployment would also remain elevated, with devastating effects for individuals in terms of labour market ""scarring"".', 'And this would ultimately affect society as a whole as, given our demographics, realising the potential of the young and their capacity for innovation is essential for long-term sustainability.', 'Second, a situation of persistently low potential growth would make it even harder to work through the debt overhang that still exists in parts of the euro area.', 'For firms that took on debt based on pre-crisis growth expectations, low potential growth acts as a major barrier to new investment, as any profits generated will likely be absorbed by servicing existing debt.', 'The reason is that low potential growth implies a lower equilibrium real interest rate, which in turn means that, faced with a negative output gap, nominal policy rates need to go lower still to steer output back to potential.', 'But we should recognise that our weak long-term performance also provides an opportunity.', 'Since many economies are distant from the frontier of best practice in at least some policy areas, the gains from structural reforms are easier to achieve and the potential magnitude of such gains is greater.', 'We also have scope for a large catching-up in terms of productivity growth.', 'The type of policies that could release this upward shock to potential growth are not just those focused on price flexibility.', 'They include, on the labour supply side, policies aimed at providing job search support for the long-term unemployed and requalification for the low skilled.', 'They are about unleashing an untapped potential for substantially higher output, employment and welfare.', 'And in the current environment, this would play a crucial role in ensuring that the ongoing cyclical recovery becomes a stronger, structural recovery.', 'A parallel argument in favour of postponing structural reforms relates to their short-term effects on employment.', 'The reasoning is that reforms implemented at the trough of the cycle or too early in the recovery may increase job insecurity among workers, which may in turn result in a rise in precautionary savings and thereby reduce consumption.', 'Factors such as a depressed housing market would also exacerbate these effects by hindering geographical mobility and the reallocation of resources.', 'For example, research suggests that reforms that increase employment flexibility, such as reducing employment protection, are more likely to depress demand during downturns.', 'The reason is that the short-term impact of structural reforms does not just depend on they are implemented, but - namely, the of reforms, the of reforms and their with other policy measures.', 'And if structural reforms are well-designed along these parameters, they can in fact have a largely neutral, if not positive impact on short-term demand - and even in adverse cyclical conditions.', 'This is because, for firms, an upward shift in potential growth implies higher expected revenues and higher future profitability, which should in turn encourage them to bring forward investment into the present.', 'And investment, remember, raises both supply tomorrow and demand today.', 'A similar logic applies to households and their life-cycle income.', 'Reforms that raise expectations of life-cycle income should immediately support current consumption.', 'To give just one example of this effect, an extension of the retirement age should lift not only medium-term supply - by expanding the active population - but also short-term demand, by reducing the need for precautionary savings ahead of retirement.', 'But credibility is crucial in determining how quickly these positive effects materialise.', 'If there is uncertainty about the timeline over which reforms will be implemented, or about the commitment of successive governments to maintaining them, it will take longer for firms and households to adjust their expectations and the benefits of reforms will be delayed.', 'Moreover, if reforms are not perceived to be sustainable under a wide variety of conditions - for example, if a pension reform is unrealistic over the longer-term - agents will anticipate a reversal in the future and refrain from adjusting their behaviour today.', 'This provides a strong rationale to implement reforms in a way that is committed, credible and consistent.', 'And such an approach is in fact And such an approach is in fact important for reforms to yield short-term benefits in the special environment we face today.', 'Following seven years of crisis marked by several false dawns, firms and households have become more hesitant about taking on economic risk.', 'In this uncertain context credibility is key, as the strength of the reform signal has an even stronger determination over the magnitude of the short-term benefits.', 'Those short-term benefits can also be maximised, however, if the of reforms is carefully chosen.', 'How structural reforms affect the economy is of course complex, but the evidence suggests that the short run gains can be amplified if reforms are well designed, packaged and sequenced , with a focus on measures that minimise short-term costs.', 'This is supported by new micro level research from the Eurosystem which shows that, for a larger sample of countries, firms with flexibility at the plant-level have reduced employment less during the crisis than those bound by centralised wage bargaining agreements, partly because they have been more able to adjust wages to economic conditions.', 'Moreover, if reforms are targeted specifically at frictions that hold back investment demand, their short-term effects should be largely positive, even at the bottom of the cycle.', 'For instance, reforms directed at sectors with large pent-up demand, such as professional services and retail trade, could be expected to elicit a rapid investment response.', 'Similarly, reforms designed to reduce bottlenecks to new investment that come from onerous business conditions should also have mainly benefits in the short-term.', 'This would include measures such as reducing the administrative burden on young firms, or speeding up insolvency proceedings that raise the opportunity cost of investment by tying up capital for years longer than initially assumed.', 'Insofar as they raise expectations of future government revenue, they make public debt more sustainable, lessen the constraint of market discipline, and thereby reopen fiscal space.', 'For example, the literature suggests that a well-functioning banking sector is key to reap the short-term benefits of reforms, as it ensures that funds flow quickly to the new investment opportunities they create.', 'And by improving the transmission of those low real rates into actual borrowing conditions, it ensures that the financial sector can quickly reallocate finance to firms that capitalise on those incentives.', 'The economic outlook for the euro area is brighter today than it has been for seven long years.', 'Growth is picking up.', 'It does not eliminate the high level of structural unemployment that haunts too many countries.', 'But what the cyclical recovery does achieve is to provide near perfect conditions for governments to engage more systematically in the structural reforms that will anchor the return to growth.', 'Structural reform can raise that potential.', 'And it is the combination of these demand and supply policies that will deliver lasting stability and prosperity.']","['On the contrary, a great deal has been achieved and we have praised progress where it has taken place, including here in Portugal.', 'The two are heavily interdependent.', 'So what I would like to do today in opening our annual discussions in Sintra is, first, to explain what we mean by structural reforms and why the central bank has a pressing and legitimate interest in their implementation.', 'This means that they have two key effects.', 'These two effects are complementary.', 'Convergence is therefore essential to bind the union together, while permanent divergence caused by structural heterogeneity has the opposite effect.', 'All this confirms my main contention that the current environment, , creates no reason for delay.', ""This is by no means the end of our challenges, and a cyclical recovery alone does not solve all of Europe's problems.""]","['The same message was also conveyed repeatedly by my predecessors, in three quarters of all press conferences since the introduction of the euro.', 'These are clearly issues in which any central bank has a keen interest.', 'But this is especially true for the central bank of a monetary union - and even more so in the conditions we face today.', 'In terms of resilience, the ability of each economy in a monetary union to adjust quickly to shocks is essential for price stability and, over time, for the long-term viability of the union.', 'This in turn can lead to higher real interest rates and compound the effect of the shock.', 'Whereas in a single country setting the central bank could respond directly to such a contractionary effect, in a monetary union monetary policy cannot be tailored to developments in particular countries.', 'There are also no large-scale fiscal transfers across countries in the euro area to play a compensating role in supporting demand.', 'The way different euro area economies have reacted to the crisis bears this point out.', 'Like any political union, the cohesion of the euro area depends on the fact that each country is permanently better off within the union than without.', 'Since structural reforms in any euro area country are a legitimate interest of the whole union, there needs to be stronger ownership of reforms not just at the national level, but at the European level as well.', 'Besides this issue of resilience, as the central bank of the euro area we also have another, equally direct interest in structural reforms.', 'Today, imperfect indicators of the equilibrium real rate, such as real forward rates at long horizons, suggest that it may have fallen to much lower levels.', 'For all these reasons, structural reforms that reverse the downward drift in potential growth are now vital for the euro area, which is why I believe, as the guardian of the currency, we have a legitimate interest in talking about them.', 'And it is not difficult to understand why the benefits of reform could be so high in the euro area.', 'The important point, however, is that in the euro area today structural reforms are not about creating minor efficiencies or marginal gains.', 'But it is also important to underline that this assumption is in fact inaccurate for the euro area today.', 'It does not eliminate the debt overhang that affects parts of the Union.', 'And it does not eliminate the need for perfecting the institutional set-up of our monetary union.']"
